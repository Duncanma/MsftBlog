These utility classes float an element to the left or right, or disable floating, based on the current viewport size using the [CSS float property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float). `!important` is included to avoid specificity issues. These use the same viewport breakpoints as our grid system. Please be aware float utilities have no effect on flex items.

### Properties

| Property | Value                            | Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| class    | `float-{breakpoint}-{direction}` | Applies responsive float styles. |

_Breakpoint_ is one of:

<ul>
{{#with (contextData '@utilities-float')}}
  {{#each breakpoints}}
    <li><code>{{this}}</code></li>
  {{/each}}
{{/with}}
</ul>

## Clearfix

Easily clear floats by adding `.clearfix` **to the parent element**.

The example shows how the clearfix can be used. Without the clearfix the wrapping gray background `<div>` would not span around the floated elements.
