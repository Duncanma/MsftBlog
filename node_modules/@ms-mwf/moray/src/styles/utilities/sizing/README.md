Sizing utilities affect the width or height of an element. They can be used in combination to set size limits on elements.

## Width

Width utilities affect the behavior of an element's width by setting CSS properties such as [width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width), [max-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width), or [min-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-width).

### Properties

| Property  | Value            | Description             |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| class     | `w-auto`         | Sets the width value to `auto`. |
|           | `w-{percentage}` | Sets the width to a percentage value, either 25, 50, 75 or 100. |
|           | `w-col-{number}` | Sets the width to a percentage value represented by Grid columns. Uses numbers 1 through 12. |
|           | `mw-100`         | Sets the max-width value to 100%. |
|           | `vw-100`         | Sets the width to 100% of the viewport width. |
|           | `min-vw-100`     | Sets the min-width to 100% of the viewport width. |

### Responsive classes
A subset of width utilities support responsive behavior. The notation `{bp}` represents the breakpoint (and higher) that the styles should be applied at.

The _breakpoint_ is one of:
<ul>
{{#with (contextData '@utilities-float')}}
  {{#each breakpoints}}
    <li><code>{{this}}</code></li>
  {{/each}}
{{/with}}
</ul>

| Property  | Value                 | Description             |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| class     | `w-{bp}-auto`         | Sets the width value to `auto` at a particular breakpoint and higher. |
|           | `w-{bp}-{percentage}` | Sets the width to a percentage value (either 25, 50, 75 or 100) at a particular breakpoint and higher. |
|           | `w-{bp}-col-{number}` | Sets the width to a percentage value represented by Grid columns (1 through 12) at a particular breakpoint and higher. |

### When to use columns

The width classes represented by `w-col-{number}` are particularly useful when a Grid layout _cannot_ be used due to HTML structure requirements, but aligning element widths to the 12 column Grid is desirable. An example of this is used in [Presentational tables]({{internalLink '/components/detail/table--presentational'}}), on the `<colgroup>`'s `<col>` elements.

## Height

Height utilities affect the behavior of an element's height by setting CSS properties such as [height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height), [max-height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-height), or [min-height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-height).

> When dealing with height, percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the generated box's containing block. If the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is not absolutely positioned, the value computes to auto. A percentage height on the root element is relative to the initial containing block. See the [W3C Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#the-height-property) for more information on how height is calculated.

### Properties

| Property  | Value            | Description             |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| class     | `h-auto`         | Sets the height value to `auto`. |
|           | `h-{percentage}` | Sets the height to a percentage value, either 25, 50, 75 or 100.* |
|           | `mh-100`         | Sets the max-height value to 100%.* |
|           | `vh-100`         | Sets the height to 100% of the viewport width. |
|           | `min-vh-100`     | Sets the min-height to 100% of the viewport width. |

\* Percentage is relative to the element's containing block.
