MWF provides utility classes to create responsive embeds based on the width of the parent by creating an intrinsic ratio that scales on any device.

> These utilities can be used to embed many types of content, including videos. While MWF does not officially recommend a particular video player, many Microsoft sites use the ONE Player. Information on the ONE Player can be found in the <a href="https://www.redtigerwiki.com/wiki/Video_Platform_Overview" target="_blank">RedTiger Wiki</a>, with documentation on embedding ONE Player videos using an <a href="https://www.redtigerwiki.com/wiki/Video_iFrame" target="_blank">iframe</a> or <a href="https://www.redtigerwiki.com/wiki/Video_JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>.

```html
<!-- Embed container -->
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <!-- Embed item -->
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..." allowfullscreen title="..."></iframe>
</div>
```

### Embed container

#### Required properties

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| class | `embed-responsive` | Applies styling. |
| class | `embed-responsive-{ratio}` | Specifies the aspect ratio of the embedded content, which can be `16by9`, `21by9`, `4by3`, or `1by1`. |

### Embed item

Embedded items can use many different HTML elements, including `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, `<video>`, and `<object>`. Attributes and browser support vary depending on which HTML element is used, but the most common element used by third party video players is `<iframe>`. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe" target="_blank">Read more about `<iframe>` on MDN.</a>

> `frameborder="0"` is not required when embedding an `<iframe>` as this is set by MWF CSS.

#### Optional properties

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| class | `embed-responsive-item` | Applies styling, only required when not using one of these HTML elements: `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, `<video>`, and `<object>`. |
| allowfullscreen | | When embedding an `<iframe>` this allows it to activate fullscreen mode. |
| title | | A descriptive title should be added to `<iframe>` embeds for accessibility. |
