Two utilities are available to control how content overflows an element. For more information on the CSS overflow property and its behavior, refer to MDN's CSS [overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) documentation.

### Properties

| Property | Value              | Description             |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| class    | `overflow-{value}` | Applies overflow style  |

_Value_ is one of:

- `auto`
- `hidden`
**Note:** Use the `.overflow-hidden` class with caution. It may hide content that flows outside of the box when users adjust text spacing and resized text.
