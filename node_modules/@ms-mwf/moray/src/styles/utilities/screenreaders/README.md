Screen reader utilities are used to provide additional content to screen readers and/or people navigating a site using the keyboard.

## Screen reader only

### Properties
| Property | Value                 | Description                                               |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| class    | `sr-only`             | Visibly hides the element and its content from users, but the content remains programmatically available for screen readers. |

## Screen reader focusable

### Properties
| Property | Value                 | Description                                    |
|----------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| class    | `sr-only-focusable`   | Shows the element only when it receives focus. **Do not use in combination with `sr-only`.** |

## Screen reader focusable buttons (skip links)

`sr-only-focusable` can be combined with [button classes]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/button' }}) and [positioning utility classes]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/utilities-position' }}) to create skip links, which give keyboard users the option of skipping to or past certain content.

Skip links or other elements that appear on focus **should not cause the rest of the page content to shift or jump** when they become visible.
