Material classes are very similar to background color utilities at first glance, however, they differ in the following ways.

- Define contextual style to familiar design elements that remain consistent between themes. Themes may then be switched out without needing to modify classes in markup. 
- Define text and link color combinations for contained content.
- All have responsive classes correlating to framework defined breakpoints.
- All are contextual colors or theme colors to encourage brand consistency.

## Material types

There are two main types of materials. Both are used to create a different sense of elevation and heirarchy of content.

### Backdrop
This material is the same as the page body content; it is the foundation of the materials with the lowest visual elevation. This material is most useful when resetting or cancelling out another material on a higher viewport using the backdrop's responsive classes.

### Surface
Surfaces are used to *subtly* differentiate sections from the page body content. It is often used to create visual division in page sections and group related content.

###  Card
Card is a material that is elevated from the content around it when displayed in light themes. For dark themes, the page body color is too dark to properly display the card's elevation. In this instance, the background color is different from that of other materials to allow for an alternative layering effect. Because of this color change in dark themes, it is not recommended to nest card materials within surface materials as they may be too similar depending on the theme.

## Material color

Materials may adopt an alternative color palette based on the theme's palette. Background, text and link colors are defined for each theme color that meets the 4.5:1 color contrast ratio. Avoid nesting elements that use material color classes, as CSS specifity issues may break the approved color combinations. If nesting is nessecary, use background utilities on parent elements whenever possible to avoid link and text color conflicts.

Material color classes are not limited to elements already using Material classes such as "card". They may be applied to any layout element containing content.
