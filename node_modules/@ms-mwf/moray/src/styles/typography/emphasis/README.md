Emphasis elements indicate, stress, or visually highlight text. The following emphasis elements have custom MWF styles. In some cases, an element may also have an associated class that will apply the same styles as the native element. These classes should be used when the semantic meaning of the native element is not needed, but the text should still be styled as such. Some elements will have an external reference for more information on the element and its semantics.

## Strong
```html
<strong>This line rendered as bold text.</strong>
```

For more information on `<strong>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-strong-element).

## Em
```html
<em>This line rendered as italicized text.</em>
```

For more information on `<em>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-em-element).

## Del
```html
<del>This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.</del>
```

The `<del>` element Should only be used in body copy to indicate when text has been removed from the document. The `cite` and `datetime` attributes should be used when applicable.

For more information on `<del>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/edits.html#the-del-element).

## S

The `<s>` element is a stylistic element that does not provide semantics to assistive technology.  The `<s>` element must be used in conjunction with screen reader only text.  This will provide the information in text that is available through presentation.

```html
<s>This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.</s>
```

For more information on `<s>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-s-element).

## Ins
```html
<ins>This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.</ins>
```

Should only be used in body copy to indicate when text has been added to the document. Like the `<del>` element, the `<ins>` element should use the `cite` and `datetime` attributes when applicable.

For more information on `<ins>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/edits.html#the-ins-element).

## Mark

```html
<p>You can use the mark tag to <mark>highlight</mark> text.</p>
```

The `<mark>` element is a stylistic element that does not provide semantics to assistive technology. The `<mark>` element should only be used in body or to highlight text in a list of search results. The `<mark>` element must be used in conjunction with screen reader only text.  This will provide the information in text that is available through presentation.

For more information on `<mark>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-mark-element).

## Mark class
```html
<p>You can use the mark class to <span class="mark">highlight</span> text without implying semantic meaning.</p>
```

The `.mark` class is a stylistic element that does not provide semantics to assistive technology. The `.mark` class must be used in conjunction with screen reader only text.  This will provide the information in text that is available through presentation. The `.mark` class must not be used in conjunction with an element that may communicate a different semantic meaning (e.g. `<del>` or `<ins>`).
