Paragraph elements hold text that should be displayed as a paragraph. Paragraph elements in MWF have custom margins, but can be adjusted through the use of [utility classes]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/utilities-spacing--margin' }}).  In some cases, an element may also have an associated class that will apply the same styles as the native element. These classes should be used when the semantic meaning of the native element is not needed, but the text should still be styled as such.

## Paragraph
```html
<p>A paragraph (from the <a href="#">Ancient Greek</a> παράγραφος paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is aself-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consistsof one or more sentences. Though not required by the <a href="#">syntax</a> of any language, paragraphs are usually anexpected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
```

## Lead
Lead paragraphs increase the font-size of a paragraph to give greater visual weight for large viewports. Lead paragraphs styles can be applied by adding the `lead` class.

```html
<p class="lead">It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples.</p>
```
