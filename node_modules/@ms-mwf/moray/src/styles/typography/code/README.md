Code elements denote how text should be observed -- `<code>` tags represent text that should be observed as computer code, `<kbd>` tags for user input, and `<pre>` tags for preformatted text. These elements have custom MWF styles. Some elements will have an external reference for more information on the element and its semantics.

## Code
```html
<code>This line indicates computer code.</code>
```

For more information on `<code>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-code-element).

## Kbd
```html
<kbd>This line indicates user input from a device -- like a keyboard.</kbd>
```

For more information on `<kbd>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-kbd-element).

## Pre
```html
<pre>This line of text renders exactly as it would in a HTML file.</pre>
```

For more information on `<pre>` elements, see [Whatwg's HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-pre-element).
