All HTML headings, `<h1>` through `<h6>`, are available. Heading font sizes are responsive, allowing text to scale more naturally across device and viewport sizes.

## Hierarchy and semantics

It is critical to follow the rules of [heading hierarchy and semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#Accessibility_concerns). In general the HTML heading levels in components are not prescriptive and should be modified to suit the overall heading hierarchy of the page in which they are used.

Because components often expect a particular heading font size, `.h1` through `.h6` classes are provided for instances in which the semantic HTML heading level needs to be different from the heading font size used in the component.

```html
<h3 class="h2">I am an h3 element styled as an h2.</h3>
```

## Display headings

Traditional heading elements are designed to work best in the meat of your page content. When you need a heading to stand out, consider using a **display heading**â€”a larger, slightly more opinionated heading style.
