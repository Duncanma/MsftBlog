The default theme used by MWF Moray's standard Microsoft store stylesheet (`main.css`) is a light theme with the Microsoft core blue as its Primary accent color. If your site requires a theme other than the standard Microsoft store theme, alternate brand themes can be found in the `dist/css/themes` folder of the distributed npm package.

## Toggling dark and light themes within a page

Both a "light" and "dark" version of each theme can be enabled simultaneously through the source `_variables.scss`. Currently, this feature is enabled by default by MWF. However, if not nessecary, it is recommended to toggle this feature off at SCSS compile time for a leaner CSS file.

To assign a "light" or "dark" version of the theme to a portion of the page, use the class `theme-light` or `theme-dark` on a wrapping element, such as a `<section>` element. 

Due to the cascading effects of CSS and specificity issues, MWF does not support nesting `theme-light` and `theme-dark` elements. For this reason, if the majority of your site requires a "dark" theme, it is recommended to use an alternate version of the MWF Moray `main.css` whose default theme is "dark". Using the alternate stylesheet, shift only the outlying sections to "light" using `theme-light`.

> Stylesheets whose default theme is light, only apply style rules for `theme-dark` and will ignore `theme-light`. Conversely, stylesheets those default theme is dark will only apply rules for `theme-light` while ignoring `theme-dark`.

## Creating a custom theme

Custom themes can be compiled from the framework's source SCSS. Below is an example SCSS file that can be compiled to create a default dark theme using Xbox brand colors as accent colors. The SCSS variables defined in this file override the nessecary values to generate the new theme.

```scss
$theme-default: "dark" !default;

// Accent colors
$core:          #107c10 !default;
$core-alt:      #5dc21e !default;

$brand:         #107c10 !default;
$brand-dark:    #054b16 !default;
$brand-light:   #9bf00b !default;

@import "../main.scss"; // Import the MWF Moray main scss
```

### Accent colors

The "core" variables defined in the example above, map to the theme's Primary palette. Primary colors are used universally for navigation, form elements, buttons, and other UI elements, to help accentuate interactivity. The "brand" variables map to the theme's default Brand color. Brand colors are used sparingly as a way to make content pop with color, while maintaining consistency with the brand.

All accent colors must meet the color contrast requirements listed below:

| Variable name  | Contrast requirement |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `$core`        | Must pass a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio with `#fff` |
| `$core-alt`    | Must pass a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio with `#000` |
| `$brand`       | There are no specific restrictions on brand color. |
| `$brand-dark`  | Must pass a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio with `#fff` and `$brand-light` |
| `$brand-light` | Must pass a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio with `#000` and `$brand-dark`  |
