A 12 column system that uses a series of containers, rows and columns to layout and align content. The MWF grid is built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Use the [flex utilities]({{internalLink '/components/detail/utilities-flex'}}) on grid elements for further control on styles like order and positioning.

```html
<!-- Container -->
<div class="container">
  <!-- Row -->
  <div class="row">
    <!-- Column -->
    <div class="col">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      One of three columns
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Responsive breakpoints
Since MWF is developed to be mobile first, it uses a handful of media queries to create sensible  breakpoints for layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow elements to scale up as the viewport changes.

MWF uses a t-shirt size naming convention that maps to Microsoft's standard viewport numbers when representing these breakpoints in class names. The following class name extensions are used throughout the framework, in the grid system, utilities and components.

| MWF class name extension | Microsoft viewport # | min-width | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `xs` | 1 | 0      | Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 540px). Generally the `xs` extension isn't needed as this is the default. |
| `sm` | 2 | 540px  | Small devices (landscape phones, 540px and up) |
| `md` | 3 | 860px  | Medium devices (tablets, 860px and up) |
| `lg` | 4 | 1084px | Large devices (desktops, 1084px and up) |
| `xl` | 5 | 1400px | Extra large devices (large desktops, 1400px and up) |


## Containers
Containers are the most basic layout element in MWF and are required when using the grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers _can_ be nested, **nesting containers is not recommended for most layouts**.

### Options
| Class name        | Description                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `container`       | Default. Applies container styles, has a max-width of 1600px. |
| `container-fluid` | Applies fluid container styles. Use instead of `container` to achieve full width layouts that span the entire width of the viewport. |


## Rows
Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins. This way, all the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side.

### Requirements
| Class name    | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `row`        | Applies row styles.           |

### Options
| Class name    | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `no-gutters` | Sets margin to 0 on the `.row` and gutters to 0 on immediate children columns. |

## Columns
All content must be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows. Column widths are set in percentages, so they're always fluid and sized relative to their parent element. Columns have a built in 12px of padding on left and right creating a 24px gutter between two columns, unless removed by applying `.no-gutters` on the parent `.row`.

### Options
Column classes indicate the number of columns you'd like to use out of the possible 12 per row. Multiple column classes can be used on a single column to create different layouts by viewport.

| Class name                        | Description                        |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `col`                             | Applies equal width column styles. |
| `col-{breakpoint}`                | Applies equal width column styles starting at the specific breakpoint. Can be `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, or `xl`. |
| `col-{# of columns}`              | Applies column styles set to the width of the specific number of columns, can be any number starting at 1 through 12. |
| `col-{breakpoint}-{# of columns}` | Applies column styles set to the width of the specific number of columns, starting at the specific breakpoint. |
| `col-auto`                        | Sizes columns based on the natural width of their content. |
| `col-{breakpoint}-auto`           | Sizes columns based on the natural width of their content at the specific breakpoint. |

## Row Columns
Use the responsive `.row-cols-*` classes to quickly set the number of columns that best render your content and layout. Whereas normal `.col-*` classes apply to the individual columns (e.g., `.col-md-4`), the row columns classes are set on the parent `.row` as a shortcut.

Use these row columns classes to quickly create basic grid layouts or to control [card layouts]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/card-layout--grid' }}).

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row row-cols-2">
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Options
Row column classes indicate the number of columns you'd like out of a possible 6 per row. Multiple row column classes can be used on a single row to create different layouts by viewport.

| Class name                             | Description                         |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `row-cols-{# of columns}`              | Sets number of columns inside `.row`. |
| `row-cols-{breakpoint}-{# of columns}` | Sets number of columns inside `.row` at the specific breakpoint. |


## Offsetting columns
Grid columns can be offset in two ways: responsive `.offset-*` grid classes and [margin utilities]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/utilities-spacing--margin' }}). Grid classes are sized to match columns while margins are more useful for quick layouts where the width of the offset is variable.

### Offset classes
Move columns to the right using `.offset-*` classes. These classes increase the left margin of a column by * columns.

#### Options
Offset classes must be applied to element with column classes.

| Class name               | Description                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `offset-{# of columns}`  | Increases left margin by the number of columns specified. |
| `offset-{breakpoint}-{# of columns}` | Increases left margin by the number of columns specified at the specific breakpoint. |

### Margin utilities
Use [margin utilities]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/utilities-spacing--margin' }}) like `.mr-auto` to force sibling columns away from one another.


## Nesting
To nest content with the default grid, add a new `.row` and set of `.col-*` columns within an existing `.col-*` column. Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12 or fewer (it is not required to use all 12 available columns).

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-9">
      Level 1: .col-sm-9
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8 col-sm-6">
          Level 2: .col-8 .col-sm-6
        </div>
        <div class="col-4 col-sm-6">
          Level 2: .col-4 .col-sm-6
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
