Images in components are embedded using the `<img>` or `<picture>` elements. [Picturefill](https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) polyfill is used to ensure browser support for `<picture>` elements and the `srcset` attribute. Use an `<img>` element to embed an image from a single source, and a `<picture>` element with `<source>` elements to render images of different sizes and resolutions depending on the viewport.

## Responsiveness

 When using a `<picture>` element, each `<source>` element must have a `srcset` attribute specifying one or more Image url sources and the `<img>` element should have a `srcset` attribute for fallback purposes as well. Images are made responsive by media queries in the `<source>` elements which correspond to the breakpoints in the [Grid](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/grid/index.html). The first `<source>` with a `media` attribute that matches the userâ€™s context will determine the `src` of the `<img>` element. 

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1596x720, https://via.placeholder.com/3192x1440 2x" media="(min-width: 1400px)">
  <source srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1260x726, https://via.placeholder.com/2520x1452 2x" media="(min-width: 1084px)">
  <source srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1083x640, https://via.placeholder.com/2166x1280 2x" media="(min-width: 860px)">
  <source srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/859x540, https://via.placeholder.com/1718x1080 2x" media="(min-width: 540px)">
  <img srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/539x440, https://via.placeholder.com/1078x880 2x" class="img-fluid" alt="placeholder text for image"  >
</picture>
```

Apply the `.img-fluid` class to the Image so that it scales with the parent element. Image width changes based on parent width, and can never go beyond it. Image height changes automatically, together with the width, to prevent Image distortion.  

Newer devices frequently have displays with higher pixel densities (sometimes known as "Retina" displays). A common strategy to ensure that Images look crisp on these displays is to provide an Image that is double the size that would normally be provided, and instruct the browser to load the appropriate Image using the [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-srcset) attribute.

```html
<img srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/732x250, https://via.placeholder.com/1464x500 2x" class="img-fluid" alt="placeholder text for image"  >
```

## Style

Image component can be styled with the following classes. When using the `<picture>` element to specify multiple `<source>` elements for a specific `<img>`, make sure to add the `.img-*` classes to the `<img>` and not to the `<picture>` tag.

### Modifier classes

| Class              | Description                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `img-flex-auto`    | Fixes an issue in IE11 which causes additional whitespace to appear under a full-width Image |
| `img-fluid`        | Makes an Image responsive so it cannot exceed the width of its parent element |
| `img-object-cover` | Sets `object-fit` to `cover` for browsers that support the property, and falls back to full-width in browsers that don't |
| `img-thumbnail`    | In addition to our border-radius utilities, you can use `.img-thumbnail` to give an Image a rounded 1px border appearance. |

### Utility classes

| Utility | Example          | Description | Documentation |
