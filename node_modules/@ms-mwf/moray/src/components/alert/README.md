An alert is a message that notifies the user to new information. They are useful for conveying an error, changes to the user's session, a successful action, or an announcement.

**Note**: The announcement bar (full-bleed message) has slightly different HTML markup and required and optional properties. Please see [Announcement bar](#announcement-bar-full-bleed-message) below for more detailed requirements on implementation.

```html
<!-- Alert element-->
<div class="alert" role="alert" aria-live="polite">
  <!--Glyph-->
  <span class="glyph-prepend glyph-prepend-{glyph-name}" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  <!-- Content wrapper -->
  <div class="alert-content">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```
## Alert element

### Required properties

| Property      | Value                   | Description |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| aria-live     | `polite` \| `assertive` | Screen reader notification priority. `polite` should be considered default. |
| class         | `alert`                 | Applies styling to the alert element |
| role          | `alert`                 | Describes the element as an alert message to assitive technology |

### Optional properties

| Property      | Value                 | Description |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| class         | `alert-full-bleed` | Applies styling to the alert element |
|               | `glyph-prepend glyph-prepend-{glyph-name}` | Adds a glyph to the alert. Both classes are necessary. Recommended glyphs include `info`, `accept`, and `warning`.
|               | `material-color-{theme-color}`         | Applies standard button style and color. See [Theme colors](#theme-colors) for a complete list of supported suffixes. |

## Glyph
Glyphs for alerts are optional. Recommended glyphs include `info`, `accept`, and `warning`. To display a glyph, both `glyph-prepend` and `glyph-prepend-{glyph-name}` classes must be applied.

### Required properties
| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| class | `glyph-prepend` | Applies glyph styling. |
| | `glyph-prepend-{glyph-name}` | Applies glyph styling. |
| aria-hidden | `true` | Required for Assistive Technology. |

## Content wrapper

All message contents within an Alert is contained by the Content wrapper.

### Required properties

| Property      | Value                   | Description |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| class         | `alert-content`         | Applies styling to the elements contained within |

the content wrapper may contain elements such as [headings](#headings), paragraphs, links, and dividers. For example:

```html
<div class="alert-content">
  <!-- Heading -->
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>

  <!-- Message Text -->
  <p>An alert message indicating a successful action. <a href="#next-task">Continue tonext task</a></p>

  <!-- Divider -->
  <div class="divider"></div>

  <p>Additional content below the divider.</p>
</div>
```

### Heading

A heading within an Alert must have the class `alert-heading` applied. It is the only content element that has a class specific to Alerts. If semantic heading elements are used, they *must* follow the appropriate document structure.

#### Required Properties

| Property      | Value                                          | Description |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| class         | `alert-heading`                                | Applies styling to the heading element |

### Message Text

Text nodes (not including headings or other block-level elements) should always be contained within paragraph elements. No additional properties or classes are required for `<p>` tags. Links should always be nested within a paragraph. No additional classes are required to style links within Alerts, however if background utility classes are being applied to the Alert, link color may need to be managed to maintain proper color contrast with the background.

### Divider

A divider may be added to an Alert to visually separate the main alert message from supplementary text. The divider *must not* be implemented using the semantic `<hr />` tag. This means that the element must be a non-semantic element such as a `<div>` with the `divider` class applied. For more information see [Divider]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/divider--divider-style' }}).

## Dismissible alerts

Alerts may be "closed" or "removed" by a user. To enable this functionality, the following requirements must be met.

```html
<!-- Alert element -->
<div class="alert alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert" aria-live="polite">
  <!-- Content wrapper -->
  <div class="alert-content">
    ...
  </div>
  <!-- Close button -->
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close alert" title="Close"></button>
</div>
```

***All options and requirements for standard alerts apply to dismissible alerts with the following additions:***

| type          | `button`                | Required to prevent accidental form submission |

## Announcement bar (full bleed message)
The alert component can be used for displaying a full-bleed message and link, e.g. a product announcement.

```js
alert = new mwf.Alert({
  el: document.querySelector('#alertId')
});
```
