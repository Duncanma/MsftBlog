Action Trigger gives either an `<a>` (anchor) element or `<button>` element the appearance of a  [Link Button](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/button/index.html#link)—including specialized glyph support and custom inactive styles—except it does not fill the same amount of space as a button.

Because it lacks the padding of a button, it better aligns with surrounding content and is recommended over Link Button in most cases.

Like link text, Action Trigger may only be used on a background color that meets the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio, or 3:1 for text greater than 18 point or 14 point bold.

## Style
Action Triggers should always be `<a>` or `<span>` elements with a text node inside.

```html
<a class="action-trigger">Action trigger</a>
```

or

```html
<button class="action-trigger">Action trigger</button>
```

| Class            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `action-trigger` | Applies characteristic Action Trigger styling.

The inactive state should be used for Action Triggers that are pressed or selected but still focusable.

### Modifier classes
| Class      | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `inactive` | Applies inactive styles _Note: must be used with HTML or ARIA attributes noted below_ |
| `disabled` | Applies disabled styles _Note: not recommended; see [disabled](#disabled) example under behavior_ |

The inactive state must be accompanied by relevant HTML or ARIA attributes to ensure that users know the purpose of the control. For example:
- If the control is inactive because it is pressed, use `aria-pressed="true"`. The aria-pressed="true" attribute must be used on a *toggle button*. It must not be used on a *link*
- If the control is inactive because it is the currently selected item in a set, use the `aria-current` attribute with the correct value

### Supporting components

#### Glyphs

[Glyphs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/glyphs--glyphs.html) may be used decoratively; they can be included by adding the appropriate `glyph-prepend`/`glyph-append` classes to the Action Trigger element:

```html
<button class="action-trigger glyph-prepend glyph-prepend-circle-plus">Action Trigger with glyph</button>
```

## Behavior

If the Action Trigger’s only purpose is to take the user to a new page or section of a page, the anchor element must be used.

```html
<a href="/page-url" class="action-trigger">Action trigger text</a>
```

If the Action Trigger submits a form or controls some other dynamic action, the button element must be used.

```html
<button class="action-trigger">Action Trigger text</button>
```

If the Action Trigger does not have a text value, or the text value is not clear about the function of the Action Trigger, the Action Trigger element must include an `aria-label` attribute that adequately describes the purpose of the Action Trigger.

### Disabled

Disabled Action Triggers that are `<button>` elements must use the `disabled` property.

```html
<button class="action-trigger" disabled>Submit</button>
```

To disable an Action Trigger that is an anchor element, add the class `.disabled`, `aria-disabled="true"`, and a `tabindex="-1"` attribute to the `<a>` tag. The disabled class uses `pointer-events: none`, while the negative tab index will prevent the link from receiving keyboard focus. To be safe, use custom JavaScript to disable any functionality on the anchor element. **This is not recommended**, as a "disabled" link is not semantically correct.

```html
<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="action-trigger disabled" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">Next</a>
```

Disabled Action Triggers are not required to pass color-contrast requirements. For this reason, be careful not to apply the `disabled` class to an Action Trigger that is not truly disabled.
