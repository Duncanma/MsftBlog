A Badge is an `inline-block` `<span>` of text, typically set apart by its background color. It is not interactive. 

## Responsiveness

Badges often have their width constrained. If a Badge's text is too long to fit on one line, the text will wrap, and the background color will create a rectangle around the text (see the [Long Text](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/badge--long-text.html) variant for details). Words will be split and wrapped only if they do not fit on a single line by themselves.

The default wrapping behavior can be changed by using the utility class `text-truncate`, which is documented in more detail [here](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/utilities-text--wrapping-and-overflow.html). Using this utility class, Badge text will instead be truncated if it does not fit, and excess text will be replaced with an ellipsis. The [Truncate](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/badge--truncate.html) variant is a demonstration of this.

## Style

To appear as expected, the Badge must have the following structure:

```html
<span class="badge">{badge-text}</span>
```

Badges should always be a `<span>` with some text inside. The following properties are also required:

| Property        | Value                 | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `class`         | `badge`               | Applies characteristic Badge styling |

### Utility classes

The following utility classes are often used with Badge:

| Utility           | Example             | Description| Documentation |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| Background color  | `bg-yellow`         | Sets background color (and text color if required for color contrast) | [Background color utilities docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/utilities-color--colors.html) |
| Text color        | `text-neutral-400`  | Sets text color | [Text color utilities docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/utilities-color--theme-neutrals.html) |
| Padding           | `pb-0`              | Sets padding | [Padding utilities docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/utilities-spacing--padding.html) |
| Text wrapping and overflow | `text-truncate` | Truncates text instead of wrapping it | [Wrapping utilities docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/utilities-text--wrapping-and-overflow.html) |

### Empty Badge

A Badge will change to `display: none` whenever it is empty (i.e., valid for the `:empty` CSS selector, so no text and no children). Note that pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before` and `::after`) don't count as children, so a Badge with [Glyph](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/glyphs--glyphs.html) classes (e.g., `glyph-prepend` and `glyph-prepend-info`), but no other text or children, will not display.
