The Link Group component consistently aligns and spaces a set of links. The links may be styled as Calls to Action (CTAs), Buttons, or un-styled `<a>` elements in any combination.

Each link in a Link Group is displayed as an `inline-block`. So, when the width of the Link Group is constrained, the links will stack vertically to avoid wrapping text.

## Style

To use a Link Group, wrap any number of links in a `<div>` with the class `link-group`.

```html
<div class="link-group">
  {links}
</div>
```

> Every link must be an actual `<a>` tag, not `<button>`s or anything else.

> Every link should be a child of the Link Group wrapper. The Link Group should have no other child elements besides links.

These properties are required:

| Property        | Value                 | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `class`         | `link-group`          | Applies characteristic Link Group styling |

### Supporting components

The Link Group helps to organize groups of plain links, but also [Button-Styled Links](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/button/index.html) and [Calls to Action](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/call-to-action/index.html) or any combination of those.
