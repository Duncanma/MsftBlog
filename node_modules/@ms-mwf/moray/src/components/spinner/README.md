The Spinner is an indeterminate progress indicator (it shows that progress is happening, but not how much). It can be used as a placeholder while content loads, such as large images or asynchronously-retrieved content.

Sample html:
```html
<div id="spinner-1" class="spinner spinner-lg" tabindex="-1" role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
  <span class="sr-only">Content is loading</span>
  <span role="presentation" class="spinner-dot spinner-dot-1"></span>
  <span role="presentation" class="spinner-dot spinner-dot-2"></span>
  <span role="presentation" class="spinner-dot spinner-dot-3"></span>
  <span role="presentation" class="spinner-dot spinner-dot-4"></span>
  <span role="presentation" class="spinner-dot spinner-dot-5"></span>
</div>
```

## `<div>` Wrapper

```html
<div id="spinner-1" class="spinner spinner-lg" tabindex="-1" role="alert" aria-live="assertive">
  ...
</div>
```

## `.spinner-dot` `<span>` Elements

```

There should be five `<span>` elements, each of which is a dot in the spinner, numbered accordingly

### Required Properties

| Property       | Value                 | Notes  |
|----------------|-----------------------|--------|

## Screen Reader `<span>` Element

```html
<span class="sr-only">Content is loading</span>
```
The purpose of this element is to provide narration for screen reader users. The text should change once the content has loaded (see [Accessibility Notes](#accessibility-notes) below)

### Required Properties

| Property       | Value                 | Notes  |
|----------------|-----------------------|--------|
| (text)         | Content is loading    | Must be localized, should be customized (e.g. "Game review is loading", must be descriptive |
| class          | sr-only               | Narrated, but not visible |


## Accessibility Notes

**Special Note on id:** It is good accessibility practice to point to the spinner with an `aria-describedby` attribute on the loading region. In this case, `id` would be required.

**Special Note on `.sr-only` span** Once the content has finished loading the text should be updated to that effect (e.g. "The content has loaded") *before* the spinner is hidden or removed, so that screen reader users will hear narration indicating that loading has finished.

**Special Note for loading region:** The attribute `aria-busy` should be set to `true` on the loading region until it is finished loading.
