The Button component  is a set of controls and interactive elements styled to visually appear as Buttons, it is different from the `<button>` element. A Button can be either an `<a>` (anchor) element, an HTML `<button>` element, or a `<label>` element depending on how it is used. For accessibility reasons, it is important to use appropriate element (and not just always a `<button>`) to help the user know what will happen next - leaving the page, setting a radio button, etc.

Buttons may only be used on a background color that meets the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio, or 3:1 for text greater than 18 point or 14 point bold.

- If the Button's only purpose is to take the user to a new page or section of a page, the anchor element must be used. 
```html
	<a href="/page-url" class="btn btn-primary">Link to page</a>
```

- If the Button submits a form or other dynamic action, the `<button>` element must be used. Button should have `type="button"` unless it is a `submit` Button for a form, then it should have `type="submit".`

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Cancel</button>
```

- If the Button works as a styled radio button or check box, the Button must be a `<label>` element wrapping the associated input control. Additional JavaScript is required to manage the `active` class on the label. The `active` class must only be present when the input is checked.

```html
<label class="btn btn-secondary active">
  <input type="checkbox" checked autocomplete="off"> Checked
</label>
```

## Style
### Solid buttons

When using a solid Button, ensure the Button background color meets a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with the background behind it. A class of `btn-{theme-color}` should also be used to apply the appropriate theme style and color. See [Theme colors](#theme-colors) for a complete list of supported suffixes.

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">View cart</button>
```

### Outline buttons

When using an outline Button, ensure the Button text meets the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background it. A class of `btn-outline-{theme-color}` should also be used to apply the appropriate theme style and color. See [Theme colors](#theme-colors) for a complete list of supported suffixes.

```html
<a href="#" class="btn btn-outline-primary">View cart</a>
```

### Faint buttons

When using a faint Button, ensure the Button text meets the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the background it. A [glyph](#utility-classes) is required for faint Buttons per accessibility guidelines in order to make the Button stand out from regular text.  A class of `btn-faint-{theme-color}` should also be used to apply the appropriate theme style and color. See [Theme colors](#theme-colors) for a complete list of supported suffixes.

```html
<a href="/cart" class="btn btn-faint-primary glyph-prepend glyph-prepend-shopping-cart">View cart</a>
```

Per accessibility guidelines noted under "Faint Buttons", faint Buttons *must* contain either the `glyph-prepend` or `glyph-append` classes. This is unique to faint Buttons. See [Utility classes](#utility-classes).

### Inverted buttons

An inverted Button must be placed on a background that meets the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio with the Button's background color. Typically, this Button type is only recommended to be used when placed on a brand color background. Inverted Buttons must always have a black or white background color, depending on the contrast needs of the Button text.  A class of `btn-inverted-{theme-color}` should also be used to apply the appropriate theme style and color. See [Theme colors](#theme-colors) for a complete list of supported suffixes.

```html
<a href="#" class="btn btn-inverted-primary-alt">View cart</a>
```

### Link buttons

Link Buttons are used to imitate hyperlink text. Like link text, they may only be used on a background color that meets the minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

Because link Buttons use the same padding as default Buttons, [action triggers]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/action-trigger' }}) are recommended unless they need to fill the same space as Buttons. Link Buttons also use custom inactive styles.

```html
<button class="btn btn-link">View cart</button>
```

#### Inactive

The inactive state should be used for link Buttons that are pressed or selected but still focusable.

```html
<button class="btn btn-link inactive">Add to cart</button>
```

The inactive state must be accompanied by relevant HTML or ARIA attributes to ensure that users know the purpose of the control. For example; if the control is inactive because it is pressed, use `aria-pressed="true"`.

### Disabled

Disabled Buttons that are `<button>` elements must use the `disabled` property.

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" disabled>Submit</button>
```

To disable a Button that is an anchor element, add the class `.disabled`, add `aria-disabled="true"`, and a `tabindex="-1"` attribute to the `<a>` tag. The disabled class uses `pointer-events: none`, while the aria-disabled attribute indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable, and the negative tab index will prevent the link from receiving keyboard focus. To be safe, use custom JavaScript to disable any functionality on the anchor element. **This is not recommended**, as a "disabled" link is not semantically correct.

```html
<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="btn btn-primary disabled" aria-disabled="true" tabindex="-1">Next</a>
```

Disabled Buttons are not required to pass color contrast requirements. For this reason, be careful not to apply the `disabled` class to a Button that is not truly disabled.
### Modifier classes

| Class       | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `btn-lg`    | Increases the size of the Button |
| `btn-sm`    | Decreases the size of the Button **This is not recommended as font size may be too small to meet accessibility requirements.**|
| `btn-block` | Applies a block-level style to Button, forcing it to span the width of its container |

### Utility classes

| Utility | Example                      | Description | Documentation |
| Glyph   | `glyph-prepend`              | Sets glyph before text. Both the base `glyph-prepend` class and `glyph-prepend-{glyph-name}` must be used together. This class pair must not be used with `glyph-append`. | [Glyph utility docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/glyphs--glyphs.html) |
| Glyph   | `glyph-prepend-{glyph-name}` | Sets glyph before text. Both the base `glyph-prepend` class and `glyph-prepend-{glyph-name}` must be used together. This class pair must not be used with `glyph-append`. | [Glyph utility docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/glyphs--glyphs.html) |
| Glyph   | `glyph-append`               | Sets glyph after text. Both the base `glyph-append` class and `glyph-append-{glyph-name}` must be used together. This class pair must not be used with `glyph-prepend`. | [Glyph utility docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/glyphs--glyphs.html) |
| Glyph   | `glyph-append-{glyph-name}`  | Sets glyph after text. Both the base `glyph-append` class and `glyph-append-{glyph-name}` must be used together. This class pair must not be used with `glyph-prepend`. | [Glyph utility docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/glyphs--glyphs.html) |

### Theme colors

The following theme colors are supported for all Button styles. The listed class suffixes should used in place of `{theme-color}` for `.btn-solid-{theme-color}`, `.btn-outline-{theme-color}`, etc, to apply color and style to Buttons.

When choosing a color for stand-alone Buttons, ensure that the Button always maintains proper color contrast with the background behind it. See [solid Buttons](#solid-buttons), [outline Buttons](#outline-buttons), and [faint Buttons](#faint-buttons) for each variant's color contrast requirements.

| Theme color           | Class suffix    | Description |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Primary*              | `primary`       | Primary is considered the default Button color for a theme. |
| Primary Alternative*  | `primary-alt`   | Primary alternative is used in place of Primary when Primary does not pass color contrast with the background. |
| Secondary*            | `secondary`     | Currently a synonym for Inverse |
| Inverse*              | `inverse`       | Neutral color that maintains a high contrast with the body color. |
| Light                 | `light`         | Recommended to be used against a darker non-contextual color background. Typically used with brand color backgrounds. |
| Dark                  | `dark`          | Recommended to be used against a lighter non-contextual color background. Typically used with brand color backgrounds. |
| Brand                 | `brand`         | The brand color of the theme |
| Brand Light           | `brand-light`   | A lighter brand alternative. Recommended to be used with a Brand dark background. |
| Brand Dark            | `brand-dark`    | A darker brand alternative. Recommended to be used with Brand light. |

*Colors are contextual and will adapt depending on whether a dark or light theme is used.
