The Select component is a stylized version of the default browser `<select>` element. **The markup for the Select component differs from the original Bootstrap 4 [Custom select](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/input-group/#custom-select).** This is due to necessary accessibility fixes related to the arrow icon in Windows high-contrast mode.

## Style

The Select component is a `<div>` with the class `custom-select`.

```html
<div class="custom-select">
  ...
</div>
```

The `<select>` element is an immediate child of the `custom-select` `<div>`. It requires the class `custom-select-input`. It is followed by an empty `<span>` element with the class `custom-select-arrow`. The purpose of the `<span>` element is to display the user-interface icon for the faux select using a CSS style defined by the class `custom-select-arrow`. This element must follow the `<select>` element; a [general sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator) is used to change the style of the icon based on the state of the `custom-select-input`.

```html
<div class="custom-select">
  <select class="custom-select-input">
    ...
  </select>
  <span class="custom-select-arrow" aria-hidden="true"></span>
</div>
```

### Modifier classes

| Class                   | Element | Description |
|-------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `is-invalid`            | input   | Used to display the input as invalid; must be accompanied by `aria-invalid="true"` for screen readers as described in [Form Validation](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/validation/index.html) |

## Behavior

The Select component does not implement a custom menu to display options. Instead, it leverages the browser's built-in options menu; such menus are tailored specifically to their devices, operating systems, and ultimately user expectations, resulting in better user experiences.

To achieve a custom-styled control while still leveraging the built-in browser interface, the component consists of visible stylistic elements overlaid by an invisible browser `<select>` element. The `<select>` element, although not visible to the sighted user, is the true control the user interacts with. The "faux" select element beneath is what the user perceives as the visual interface.

```html
<!-- faux control -->
<div class="custom-select">
  <!-- actual control -->
  <select class="custom-select-input">
    ...
  </select>
  <!-- faux control icon -->
  <span class="custom-select-arrow" aria-hidden="true"></span>
</div>
```

### Icon

The icon for the Select is rendered using a glyph font unicode character. This differs from a common technique using a base64 SVG background image added to the `<select>` element. This implementation is problematic in Windows high-contrast mode, which does not render background images.

To prevent screen readers from attempting to read the empty `<span>`, the attribute `aria-hidden="true"` must be added to the element.

```html
<span class="custom-select-arrow" aria-hidden="true"></span>
```

### Label

An accompanying label is recommended but not required so long as a label is provided by some other means for assistive technology (i.e., an `aria-label` attribute on the `<select>` element). If a `<label>` is used, it must be placed outside the `custom-select` element.

```html
<label for="select-category">Select a category</label>
<div class="custom-select">
  <select class="custom-select-input" id="select-category">
    ...
  </select>
  ...
</div>
```
