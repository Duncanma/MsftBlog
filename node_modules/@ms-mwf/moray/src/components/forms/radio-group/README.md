A Radio Group is a set of [Radios](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/checkbox-radio/index.html) utilizing the `<fieldset>` element. Unlike Checkboxes, a Radio cannot function individually and should be used in groups of two or more leveraging the Radio Group component.

## Style

The `<fieldset>` element is the only element unique to the Radio Group component that requires styling by way of CSS classes. The class `form-group` is used on the `<fieldset>` to apply appropriate spacing to the Radio Group and its children.

```html
<fieldset class="form-group">
  ...
</fieldset>
```

### Modifier classes

| Class               | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `form-group-inline` | Adjusts the spacing on Radio Group and its children for inline form layouts* |

***Note:** If a Radio Group is to be displayed in an inline form layout, the class `custom-control-inline` _must also_ be applied to each of the individual Radio controls inside the `<fieldset>` containing the `form-group-inline` class. See [inline Radio and Checkbox requirements](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/checkbox-radio/index.html#inline) for more information. _When using inline Radio Groups, keep in mind that a maximum of four Radio controls should be used in a set._

### Supporting components

The custom [Radio](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/checkbox-radio/index.html) control is an essential component of the Radio Group. Although unconventional, Checkboxes may be used in place of Radio controls within Radio Groups to create multi-selections. However, extra care should be taken to implement such sets of fields properly. See [Form Validation](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/validation/index.html) for further guidance on multi-selection Checkboxes.

## Behavior

Radio Groups are sets of multiple Radio controls wrapped in a `<fieldset>` element. This element semantically identifies this grouping of controls as a related set. 

Radio Groups should also have a `<legend>` that acts as a label or key for the `<fieldset>`. The contents of the `<legend>` must describe the Radio Group. The `<legend>` must be an immediate child of the `<fieldset>` and have an `id` that is added to the `<fieldset>`'s `aria-labelledby` attribute for assistive technology.

```html
<fieldset class="form-group" aria-labelledby="like-legend">
  <legend id="like-legend">Do you like the Microsoft Store?</legend>
  ...
</fieldset>
```

Radio controls should be placed within the `<fieldset>` element following the `<legend>`. The number of Radio controls must be no less than two, but no more than four for _inline_ Radios. It is recommended that one Radio within the Radio group is `checked` by default, as keyboard interaction can be buggy otherwise. See [Checkboxes and Radios](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/checkbox-radio/index.html) for further details on controls.

```html
<div class="custom-control custom-radio">
  <input type="radio" class="custom-control-input" id="radio-yes" name="like" value="yes" checked>
  <label class="custom-control-label" for="radio-yes"><span class="custom-control-glyph" aria-hidden="true"></span>Yes</label>
</div>
<div class="custom-control custom-radio">
  <input type="radio" class="custom-control-input" id="radio-no" name="like" value="no">
  <label class="custom-control-label" for="radio-no"><span class="custom-control-glyph" aria-hidden="true"></span>No</label>
</div>
