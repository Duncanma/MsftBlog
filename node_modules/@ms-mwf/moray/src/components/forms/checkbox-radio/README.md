The Moray framework applies custom styling to checkbox and radio inputs to display them consistently across browsers and better match the Microsoft brand.

For the control to render and function properly across all necessary browser and assistive technology combinations, the following HTML and CSS class structure must be strictly adhered to.

## Style

Both controls share the same basic structure and style. A wrapping `<div>` is necessary to properly position the input element and the custom control contained within. A class of `custom-control` is required. Additionally, the class `custom-checkbox` is also required for Checkboxes or `custom-radio` for Radios.

```html
<div class="custom-control custom-checkbox">
  ...
</div>
```

| Class             | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `custom-control`  | Applies shared custom control styling for Checkboxes and Radios |
| `custom-checkbox` \| `custom-radio` | Styles the custom control as a Checkbox or Radio |

An `<input>` and `<label>` element must be placed as sibling elements within the wrapping `<div>`. The input element must have the class `custom-control-input`, while the label must have the class `custom-control-label`. For a complete list of standard HTML properties not covered below, see MDN's documentation for [checkbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) and [radio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) inputs.

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="custom-control-input" id="control01">
<label class="custom-control-label" for="control01">
  ...
</label>
```

An empty `<span>` element with the class `custom-control-glyph` must be placed inside the `<label>` element to render the custom Checkbox or Radio interface. This `<span>` must also have an `aria-hidden` attribute set to `true` to prevent screen readers from attempting to read its contents. Visible label text should follow, appropriately describing the meaning of the input.

```html
<label class="custom-control-label" for="control01">
  <span class="custom-control-glyph" aria-hidden="true"></span>Sign up for the newsletter
</label>
```

### Modifier classes

| Class                   | Element | Description |
|-------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `custom-control-inline` | wrapper | Allows the control to be positioned inline next to other inline form elements; see inline [Radio Group](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/radio-group/index.html) for a practical application |
| `is-invalid`            | input   | Used to display the input as invalid; must be accompanied by `aria-invalid="true"` for screen readers as described in [Form Validation](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/validation/index.html) |
| `disabled`*             | input   | ***Not recommended, use the HTML attribute `disabled` instead***; displays the control as if it is disabled |

***Note:** Controls should never be displayed as disabled without some additional mechanism in place to ensure the user cannot interact with the control by any means. Instead, consider the simpler approach of using the `disabled` attribute on the Checkbox or Radio's `<input>` element.
