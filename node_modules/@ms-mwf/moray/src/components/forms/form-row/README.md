Form Row is an alternative to the [Grid](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/grid/index.html)'s `row` element and is used to construct various layouts within a `<form>`. Gutter size is reduced between columns contained within a Form Row compared to the standard Grid row. Columns inside the Form Row are implemented in the same way as they are for the standard Grid.

## Responsiveness

Responsive layouts can be achieved using the same responsive row and column classes used by the standard Grid. Below are two methods for defining the same responsive 2 column layout when using a Form Row.

Using responsive classes on the columns:

```html
<div class="form-row">
  <div class="col-12 col-md-6">...</div>
  <div class="col-12 col-md-6">...</div>
</div>
```

Using responsive classes on the Form Row:

```html
<div class="form-row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2">
  <div class="col">...</div>
  <div class="col">...</div>
</div>
```

## Style

To use a Form Row in place of a standard Grid row, replace the `row` class with the `form-row` class.

```html
<div class="form-row">
  <div class="col">...</div>
  <div class="col">...</div>
</div>
```

The resulting styles will reduce the space between the columns. This is helpful for displaying related form elements closer together when placed in Grid columns.
