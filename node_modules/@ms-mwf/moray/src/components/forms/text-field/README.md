The Text Field component is a styled `<input>` or `<textarea>` HTML element. Although this component's intent is to create visual consistency between various textual form fields, essential browser-controlled interfaces will remain unchanged and will be dependent upon device and user agent.

The following `<input>` types are considered "textual" and can be styled using the Text Field component:

- [date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)
- [datetime-local](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local)
- [email](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email)
- [month](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month)
- [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number)
- [password](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password)
- [search](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search)
- [tel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel)
- [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time)
- [url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url)
- [week](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week)

The examples shown in this document have been simplified for demonstration purposes; be sure to follow all standard HTML practices when using form fields, including providing appropriate [labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/), [autocomplete attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete), [validation](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/validation/index.html), etc. See the [MDN `<input>` documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) and the [MDN `<textarea>` documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) for more details.

## Style

Text Field uses the class `form-control` to style any textual `<input>` element or `<textarea>` element.

```html
<input type="text" class="form-control">
```

### Modifier classes

The following classes can be added in addition to the `form-control` class for additional styling options.

| Value                 | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `form-control-lg`     | Increases the size of the input. |
| `form-control-sm`     | Decreases the size of the input. **This is not recommended as font size may be too small to meet accessibility requirements.** |
| `form-control-plaintext` | Styles the input to look like static text. **Must only be used with the `readonly`  attribute.** |
| `is-invalid`          | Used to display the input as invalid; must be accompanied by `aria-invalid="true"` for screen readers as described in [Form Validation](https://mwf.azurewebsites.net/catalog/validation/index.html) |
