Dividers are intended to visually separate or distinguish between elements for either aesthetic or usability purposes.

## Semantic hr
```html
<hr />
```

## hr style
```html
<div class="divider"></div>
```

## Options
| Class name            | Description                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| `.divider`            | Applies divider styles to non-`<hr>` elements. `<hr>` inherits these by default. |
| `.border-neutral-200` | Changes divider color for fainter variation. Do not use on semantic `<hr>` element unless it has a color contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against it's background. |

## Accessibility

### Semantic `<hr>` element vs presentational hr style

While the `<hr>` tag is a semantic tag, it does not always need to be narrated to the screen reader user. There will most likely be only a few use cases where it would be beneficial to have the horizontal rule narrated.

**Note**: It will narrate as "separator".

The MSCOM Accessibility Team recommends having the `<hr>` not narrated in general and only for the certain use cases as they arise.

### Color contrast

If not being able to see the divider makes it difficult for a site user to understand the visual separation, visual association or relationship of content, then the separator must pass the required color contrast ratio of 3:1 against their adjacent background.
