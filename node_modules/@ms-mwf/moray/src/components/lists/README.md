## Unstyled

Adding the class `.list-unstyled` will remove the default `list-style` and left margin on list items (immediate children only). **This only applies to immediate children list items**, meaning you will need to add the class for any nested lists as well.

## Inline

Remove a listâ€™s bullets and apply some light margin with a combination of two classes, `.list-inline` and `.list-inline-item`.

```html
{{ render '@lists--inline' }}
```
