Cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options. A Card component can optionally contain an image, header, body and footer.

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="..." class="card-img" alt="placeholder text for image">
  <div class="card-header">
    ...
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    ...
  </div>
  <div class="card-footer">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

## Responsiveness

Cards are built with flexbox which provides easy alignment and allows them to mix well with other components.

## Style

Cards are designed specifically for layout and intentionally include very little styling out of the box. Use utility classes to manage sizing, margin, borders, etc.

| Element | Class        | Description     |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Parent  | `card`       | Applies Card styles  |
| Image   | `card-img`   | This is an optional image can go above, below or, using the grid, to either side of the rest of the Card content. |
| Header  | `card-header`| This is an optional Card header, can be used to allocate space to content that appears only in some Cards within a group, helping align the Card body element across groups of Cards. 
| Body    | `card-body`  | This is the building block of a Card, contains the bulk of the Card's text content. |
| Footer  | `card-footer`| This is an optional container for Card footer content. |

### Horizontal card

Cards can be made horizontal using the grid.

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <!-- Card image -->
    </div>
    <div class="col">
        <!-- Card body -->
        <!-- Card footer -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Modifier classes

| Class               | Description     |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `flipped`           | Use when the image comes before card body in the DOM, making it appear to the left |

#### Card offset

Card offset creates a dynamic layout by offsetting the Card image from the Card body content. Unlike standard Cards, Card offset styles include padding and margin. Classes listed below need to be applied to the parent.

| Class               | Description     |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `card-offset`       | Applies styles, use **instead of** `card`|
| `card-offset-small` | Applies styles, primarily effects the padding at smaller viewports on the `card-body` |
