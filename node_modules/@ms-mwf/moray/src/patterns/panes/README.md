The Panes pattern is way to briefly showcase 3 items (Panes) of content that are related or grouped together. It uses a kind of asymmetry to visually offset each. Each placement has a short headline or product name, an image, a CTA, and may optionally include a short paragraph.

## Dependencies
- [Headings]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/headings' }})
- [Paragraphs]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/paragraphs' }})
- CTA
