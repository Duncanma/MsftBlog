This is a [Carousel]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/carousel' }}) of [Highlight]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/highlight--default' }}) slides with a sneak peek layout. It is recommended to read through the Highlight and Carousel documentation as a prerequisite to the documentation found below.

The HTML structure of the regular highlight inside a carousel is the same as a standalone regular highlight, except as [outlined below](#differences-from-regular-highlight).

## Design guidance
- Minimum of 3 highlight slides, maximum of 5.
- Each highlight within a carousel should have the same content position alignment (left, right, or center) and roughly the same amount of content in each slide.
- Highlights should either all be fully clickable, or none should be, for consistency.

## Image sizes
The highlight sneak peek carousel uses slightly different images sizes than the regular highlight:
- xl viewport: 1596x600
- lg viewport: 1260x600
- md viewport: 1083x640
- sm viewport: 859x540
- xs viewport: 539x440

## Implementation
The Highlight Sneak Peek carousel must be wrapped in a 12-column grid that removes the gutters on smaller screen sizes: `col-12 px-0 px-lg-g`.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12 px-0 px-lg-g">
    <!-- Carousel goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Differences from regular highlight
Outside of a carousel, a regular highlight typically has a heading in a `<h1>`. Since having multiple `<h1>` tags is not recommended, they should generally be changed to `<h2>` tags inside of a carousel.

Additionally, the padding on the `.card` and `.card-body` elements needs to be adjusted when a regular highlight is added to a carousel:
- Remove the `py-5 px-md-5` classes on `.card` and add `px-g px-md-5 px-lg-4`
- Add `py-4 py-md-5 py-lg-4` to `.card-body`
