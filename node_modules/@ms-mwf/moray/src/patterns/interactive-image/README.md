The Interactive Image overlays [Hotspots](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) on top of an image, each of which triggers a [Popover](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/popover.html), in order to make the image interactive. The Hotspots can also be dynamically positioned with [Positioner](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) class.

## Responsiveness

It may be desirable to position the Hotspots over the image differently depending on the size of the viewport, for example when using a `<picture>` element to display a slightly different image based on the viewport. In cases where this viewport-based positioning is known ahead of time and is not dynamic (e.g. changing based on user input), it is strongly recommended to use a stylesheet or `<style>` tag instead of the [Positioner](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) class. For example:

```css
#my-hotspot-1 {
  top: 55%;
  left: 40%;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 860px) {
  #my-hotspot-1 {
    top: 70%;
    left: 60%;
  }
}
```

Using only CSS like this will always have a better performance and tax the user's device less than using the [Positioner](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) class to achieve the same result. The [Positioner](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) class is intended for scenarios where the position of the hotspot will need to change dynamically.

## Style

The key to achieving the intended style of the Interactive Image is placing an image (either `<img>` or `<picture>`) as the first child of the Interactive Image wrapper, which is a labelled section with the `position-relative` utility class, followed by a list of Hotspot-Popovers as in this abbreviated example:

```html
<section class="position-relative" aria-label="Placeholder"> <!-- Interactive Image wrapper -->
  <img src="my-image-url.png" class="image-fluid" alt="Placeholder" /> <!-- image -->
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
      <button class="hotspot hotspot-primary" aria-controls="my-popover">1</button> <!-- Hotspot -->
      <div class="popover fade rounded-xl" role="dialog">(Popover content)</div> <!-- Popover dialog -->
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

The Interactive Image wrapper, because of its `position-relative` class, has the style `position: relative` which creates a context that allows the Hotspot buttons to be placed proportionally to the image. For this to work, the image within the wrapper should occupy the fully width of the wrapper; one way to achieve this is with the `img-fluid` class.

To make page navigation accessible, it's important to put the Hotspots in a list (`<ul>`) within the Interactive Image wrapper, but so that it doesn't take up space and throw off the positions of the Hotspots, the `list-unstyled` is required.

When considering how to make this experience accessible for all users, keep in mind that this innovative interaction pattern will likely be unfamiliar to users, so it's important to:
  - Give the `<section>` a descriptive label
  - Give the image descriptive `alt` test
  - Put the image _before_ the list of Hotspot-Popovers in the DOM
  - Put each Hotspot-Popover in a `<li>` element
  - Provide an accessible label for each Hotspot-Popover
  - Provide a skip link (visible only when focused) so that if the user wants to skip this section after learning what it is, they may, for example:

```html
<section class="interactive-image-wrapper" aria-label="Placeholder"> <!-- Interactive Image wrapper -->
  <a class="btn btn-link w-100 position-absolute bg-light sr-only-focusable" href="#content-after-interactive-image">Skip interactive image about (placeholder)</a>
  (Interactive Image content)
</section>
<div id="content-after-interactive-image">(Other content)</div>
```

In this example, the default style of the Popover dialogs have been changed to have more rounded corners using the `rounded-xl` class.

### Supporting components

The Interactive Image component makes use of the [Image](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/images.html) component. However, as discussed above, be sure to use an image that will fill the Interactive Image wrapper so the the Hotspots can be placed correctly.

Much of the particular style of the Interactive Image comes from the Hotspot buttons themselves, which are fully documented as component on the [Hotspots](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) page.

In some scenarios, it may be appropriate to use the [Positioner](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) class to dynamically position the Hotspots.

Finally, the "Interactive" part of the Interactive Images is implemented by the [Popover](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/popover.html) component, which causes the dialogs to appear when the Hotspots are pressed.

## Behavior

For information on how the [Hotspots](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) or the [Popovers](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/popover.html) they control behave, refer to their own documentation.

As discussed in the [Responsiveness](#responsiveness) section, if the position of a Hotspot is static, or only changes based on the size of the viewport, a CSS-only approach is best. But if the position of a Hotspot will need to be updated dynamically, the [Positioner](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/hotspot.html) class should be used.
