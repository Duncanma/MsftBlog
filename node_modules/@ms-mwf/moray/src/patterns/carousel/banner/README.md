This is a [carousel]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/carousel' }}) of [banner]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/banner--rounded-image' }}) slides. It is recommended to read through the banner and carousel documentation as a prerequisite to the documentation found below.

The HTML structure of the banner inside a carousel is the same as a standalone banner, except as [outlined below](#differences-from-banner).

## Required elements
- Minimum of 2 banner slides, maximum of 3.

## Implementation
The banner carousel must be wrapped in a 12-column grid that removes the gutters on smaller screen sizes.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12 px-0 px-md-g">
    <!-- Carousel goes here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Differences from banner
The outer `<div>` with class `card` **should not** have the classes `mx-ng mx-md-0` applied when it is used inside a carousel.
