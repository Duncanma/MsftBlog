This is a [Carousel]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/carousel' }}) of [full-bleed Highlight]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/highlight--full-bleed' }}) slides. It is recommended to read through the Highlight and Carousel documentation as a prerequisite to the documentation found below.

The HTML structure of the highlight full-bleed inside a carousel is the same as a standalone immersive hero, except as [outlined below](#differences-from-immersive-hero).

## Required elements
- Minimum of 2 immersive hero slides, maximum of 5.
- Each hero within a carousel should have the same content position alignment (left, right, or center) and roughly the same amount of content in each slide.

## Image sizes
The full-bleed carousel uses slightly different images sizes than the immersive hero.

### Default height
- xl viewport: 1920x720
- lg viewport: 1399x726
- md viewport: 1083x640
- sm viewport: 859x540
- xs viewport: 539x440

### Tall variant
- xl viewport: 1920x**1080**
- lg viewport: 1399x**795**
- md viewport: 1083x640
- sm viewport: 859x540
- xs viewport: 539x440

## Implementation

```html
<div class="carousel slide carousel-highlight carousel-sneak-peek" data-mount="carousel">
```

### Differences from immersive hero
Outside of a carousel, a hero typically has a heading in a `<h1>`. Since having multiple `<h1>` tags is not recommended, they should generally be changed to `<h2>` tags inside of a carousel.

Additionally, the padding on the `.card` element needs to be adjusted when an immersive hero is added to a carousel:
- Swap the `py-5 px-md-5` classes on `.card` for `px-g px-md-5 pt-4 pb-3 py-md-5`
