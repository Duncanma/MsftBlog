The development philosophy and approach to Moray has evolved from previous versions of MWF. Below are our engineering guiding principals and techniques to keep in mind as you develop with and contribute to the Moray framework.

## Utility-first CSS

Sarah Drayan's [In Defense of Utility-first CSS](https://frontstuff.io/in-defense-of-utility-first-css) is extremely influential when we think about the structure of our framework's CSS. By abstracting CSS styling from predominately BEM modifier classes to CSS properties, we can distill many components to a set of common rules. Take for example this hypothetical CSS:

```css
.hero__bg--blue {
  background-color: blue;
}

.hero__text--left {
  position: relative;
  float: left;
}

.hero__bg--right {
  position: relative;
  float: right;
}

.mosaic__tile {
  position: relative;
  float: left;
}

.mosaic__tile--blue {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

Once refactored into utility classes, the CSS required to render the same result is reduced.

```
.bg-blue {
  background-color: blue;
}

.float-left {
  float: left;
}

.float-right {
  float: left;
}

.position-relative {
  position: relative;
}
```

With only the two components above, the reduction is arguably insignificant. However as a component library grows, this reduction can become _very_ significant. An added benefit is that these styles are no longer restricted to their previous component namespaces and can be used by developers building their own custom layouts, further reducing the need for additional CSS styles to be loaded onto the page.

Admittedly, this approach is not practical for _everything_. **Framework components with namespaced CSS do still have a place at the table.** We put this concept to the test with previous beta iterations of the button component. Controlling the color of the background, outline, border, and text color across the many states of a button (hover, active, focus, etc) proved extremely difficult, particularly due to a utility's unique `!important` specificity strategy. We recognize not everything can be built with utilities only. However, there are still many design patterns that can be achieved with utilities with little to no consequence. See the Moray library "Patterns" section for a curated list of design patterns built using existing components and utilities only.
