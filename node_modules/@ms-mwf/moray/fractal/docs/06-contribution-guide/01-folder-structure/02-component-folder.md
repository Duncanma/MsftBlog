A component folder contains all related code and Fractal documentation for a specific component. Component folders must be named after the component itself&mdash; the folder name will determine the name of the component on the generated Fractal site. Likewise, all files contained within must be named to match the component folder name (with a few exceptions).

Below is a generic example of what a component folder could look like:

- component-name
  - _functions.scss
  - _mixins.scss
  - component-name.scss
  - component-name.js
  - component-name.test.js
  - component-name.hbs
  - component-name.config.json
  - README.md

As an example, examine the component "Link group" found under `src/components/link-group`. The component folder as well as the main `scss`, `hbs`, and `config.json` files are all named `link-group`.

The exception to this rule is limited to partials, imports, or similar dependencies, or `README`s. Partial filenames must be prepended with an underscore. If there are Sass mixins and functions specific to the component, they should be contained in separate files named `_mixins.scss` and `_functions.scss`. Any code that is not specific to a component or special sub-set of components (referring to Forms specifically as an outlier), should live directly under `src`, where it can be referenced within other components without creating chains of unrelated dependencies.

The only required files within a component folder are the Fractal handlebars template (`hbs`), the Fractal config (`config.json`), and the Fractal documentation (`README.md`). Depending on the scope of the component, the other files may or may not apply.
