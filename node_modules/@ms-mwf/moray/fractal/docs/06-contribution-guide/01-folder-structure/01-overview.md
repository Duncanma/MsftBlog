The Moray project structure is influenced heavily by the Fractal documentation framework. Fractal builds the documentaion site (you may be viewing now) based on folder structure.

Below is a general outline of the current project structure (as of July 2020):

- dist
  - css
  - fonts
  - js
- [fractal](#fractal)
  - docs
- [src](#src)
  - styles
    - utilities
  - components
  - patterns
  - examples
  - themes
  - js

**All files and folders must be named using [Kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab_case), with the exception of common uppercased files such as `README`s.**

## src

All source code is located under the `src` directory, organized into sub-folders which define the structure of documentation in Fractal. All components will fall into one of three folders within `src`; `components`, `patterns`, or `examples`.

Within each of these three directories you will find individual [component folders]({{ internalLink '/docs/contribution-guide/folder-structure/component-folder' }}). You may also find additional folders that group related components together, for example `src/components/forms`. For a more in-depth look at component folders, continue on to the [next section]({{ internalLink '/docs/contribution-guide/folder-structure/component-folder' }}).

## fractal

Documentation that is shown on the Fractal site but doesn't directly accompany code is found under `fractal/docs`. This page you are currently reading has a markdown file located in this directory. The MWF `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, and `CHANGELOG` docs, however, live at the project's root but get copied here at build time.

## dist

The distribution folder is where framework production assets are located, namely `css/main.min.css` and `js/bundle.min.js`. Fonts that are required by the css are located in `dist/fonts`. Polyfills for Internet Explorer 11 compatibility are found in `js/polyfills.min.js`.
