MWF adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), but there is ambiguity in applying SemVer to a component library. We use the following guidelines to interpret SemVer for this library.

## Patch
- Backwards compatible bug fixes that do not introduce changes to CSS class names or the JS public API
- **HTML changes may be introduced but must not be required** (the previous HTML should still work with no visual or functional changes)

## Minor
- New, backwards compatible functionality
  - New CSS classes
  - New JS classes or public methods
  - New components or patterns
- Minor visual or functional changes to existing CSS classes or JS public methods
  - **Some HTML updates may be required**
- Deprecation of:
  - CSS classes
  - JS classes or public methods
  - Components

## Major
- Major visual or functional changes to components
- Complete HTML rewrites of existing components
- Renaming or removal of:
  - CSS classes
  - JS classes or public methods
  - Components
