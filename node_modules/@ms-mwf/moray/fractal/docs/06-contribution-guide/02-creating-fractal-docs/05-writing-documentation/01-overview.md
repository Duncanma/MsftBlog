Good documentation allows developers of varying skill level to successfully build web experiences from the MWF component library. It is important to maintain a consistent style and structure for documentation across all components.

Fractal requires documentation to live within a file named `README.md` located in the same folder as the component's handlebars and config files. This document must be written using [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Style guidelines

Keep in mind the following style guidelines as you write:

**Dos:**

- **Write for scanning first, reading second.** Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan and read.
- **Prune excess words.** People read documentation to solve problems. Get to the point quickly and provide meaningful answers.
- **Use short everyday words, contractions, and sentence-style capitalization.** Writing should sound coherent and informal if read out loud.
- **Use the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma).**
- **Use only one space** after periods, question marks, and colons. Do not use spaces around dashes.
- **Follow [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)**. The words "must," "must not," "required," "shall," "shall not," "should," "shouldn't," "recommended," "may," and "optional" have specific meanings in technical documentation.
- **Format your tables with whitespace** so your peers can more easily read them when viewing your document as markdown.
- **Inline text that represents code should appear as `code` and letter cased according to convention.** This includes properties, attributes, values, variable names, class names, primitive types, interfaces, etc.
- **Separate values with a pipe (e.g. `String` \| `Number`)** when multiple values must be listed in a table cell.
- **Always punctuate complete sentences. Never punctuate incomplete sentences.** This also applies to content within lists and table cells.

**Don'ts:**

- **Don't use words like "you" or "we".** Instead start statements with verbs to avoid the use of personal pronouns.
- **Don't use lengthy headings.** Headings will be rendered in a sidebar navigation and must be kept brief to avoid unnecessary text wrapping.
- **Don't use duplicate headings.** The exception to this rule is in the JavaScript usage section when documenting multiple classes.
- **Don't overuse small headings within a section.** Make an effort to keep things flat. Instead, use language to transition between concepts.
