To keep technical documentation more maintainable, Moray's official documentation website imports and displays each component's `README.md` for its technical documentation section.

Component documentation should follow a consistent, shared structure whenever possible to assist the reader in scanning and navigating between components. Below is an outline of the general order and structure of information when documenting a component.

> **Note:** Not all sections will exist for every component. For example, a Badge will not have a "Behavior" or "JavaScript usage" section since it's a fairly simple CSS-only component. Form Validation will not include "Responsiveness" or "Style" as a primarily JavaScript component. Regardless of what sections are included in a document, be sure its sections follow the order of this outline.

1. [Summary](#summary)
2. [Responsiveness](#responsiveness)
3. [Style](#style)
    - [Modifier classes](#modifier-classes)
    - [Utility classes](#utility-classes)
    - [Supporting components](#supporting-components)
4. [Behavior](#behavior)
5. [JavaScript usage](#javascript-usage)
    - [Initialization](#initialization)
        - How to enable auto-initialization of a component
        - How to initialize component with options
    - [Events](#events)
    - [Static methods](#static-methods-and-instance-methods)
    - [Instance methods](#static-methods-and-instance-methods)
    - [Instance properties](#instance-properties)

## Summary

> **Do not add the header "Summary" above this section!** The top of your document should immediately start with a paragraph.

This section should contain nothing more than a paragraph or two. It should be a brief _technical_ overview of the how the component is constructed and how it works within the browser. This paragraph should not re-iterate any design or conceptual thinking, as _this information will be directly above this section on the documentation website_.

## Responsiveness

If the component includes complex responsive functionality, include that information under this section. If the component is simple and only needs a sentence or two of explanation, include it in the summary above instead.

## Style

Describe only the **HTML structure and classes** required to _visually construct_ the component. This is an important differentiation from the contents of the "Behavior" section to follow. Do not describe variants or modifier classes, as this will be covered in a subsequent sub-section. Create ***abbreviated*** code samples to illustrate.

<br>

**Example:**

 Badges should always be a `<span>` element with a text node inside.

```html
<span class="badge">{badge-text}</span>
```

| Property  | Value   | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `class`   | `badge` | Applies characteristic Badge styling. |

<br>

For very complex components, consider dividing the content up into several sub-sections by element or code fragment. Alternatively, an additional column named "Element" preceding the "Property" column can be used to associate a property with an element if the element is easily distinguishable in a single code sample (e.g. `<button>`, "dialog", etc).

### Modifier classes

Modifier classes are the namespaced classes of a component that manipulate the style of the component as a whole, or individual pieces or aspects of a component. All modifier classes must be listed in a table using this format:

<br>

**Example:**

| Class                   | Description       |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `alert-dismissible`     | Styles dismissible alerts with a close button. |
| `alert-full-bleed`      | Adjusts width and spacing of the alert's content to support a full-bleed layout. |

<br>

If modifier classes are added to multiple elements within the component, consider the following:

- **Split the table out into sections**, each with a table preceded with a description of the element. This description may have an optional ***abbreviated*** code sample to show the element in context. Sub-headings for sections are not required but should be the name of the element or sub-component when used.

- **Add an additional column named "Element"** preceding the "Property" column to associate a property with an element. This is only recommended if elements are easily distinguishable in a code sample (e.g. `<button>`, "dialog", etc). Be sure to provide an ***abbreviated*** code sample above the table for context.

<br>

**Example:**

The following classes can be added to the tab slider `<div>` element.

```html
<div data-mount="tab-slider">
```

| Class         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `tab-primary` | Sets color scheme of Tabs based on primary theme color. |

<br>

Deprecated classes must be listed until officially removed from the codebase. The word `**Deprecated.**` in bold letters must be added to the beginning of the description within the table.

<br>

**Example:**

| Element     | Class             | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Tab slider  | `tab-primary`     | Sets color of Tabs and background color of inactive Tabs based on primary theme color. See [Themes]({{ internalLink '/components/detail/theme--dark' }}) for more detail. |
| Tab slider  | `tab-horizontal`  | **Deprecated.** Applies a set of styles appropriate for a single horizontal group of Tabs. |

<br>

If the guidance around the usage has changed, or another practice should be used in its place, this notice should be provided under the table if it's too wordy for the description within the table.

### Utility classes

Utility classes are not specific to a component and are used to define (typically) a single CSS style property to the element it is applied to. Any important utilities used to create commonly used variants of the component should be listed below. Utilities should be listed by their CSS style property or namespace, therefore `text-center` and `text-left` would not be listed as separate rows, but as the CSS property "Text align" in the example column. A link to the appropriate page within the production Fractal site must be provided. Do not use the internal link helper, as this will not work on the documentation site!

<br>

**Example:**

| Utility             | Example       | Description         | Documentation |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Text align          | `text-center` | Sets text alignment | [Text align utility docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/utilities-text--alignment) |
| Margin              | `my-0`        | Sets margin         | [Margin utility docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/utilities-spacing--margin) |
| Padding             | `pb-5`        | Sets padding        | [Padding utility docs](https://moray-prod.azurewebsites.net/components/detail/utilities-spacing--margin) |

<br>

### Supporting components

These are other components within the library that are used to construct the current component being documented. Describe the role each one plays in paragraph form. If multiple paragraphs are needed, break this information down into sections by component. When introducing the supporting component, the name of the component must link to its documentation on the official documentation website.

> **Do not invent components that do not exist in the official catalog!** Anything else should be considered a piece of the current component. Build onto the documentation found towards the beginning of the Styles section, following the writing guidance for complex components.

## Behavior

This section is appropriate for components controlled with framework JavaScript. Describe the most basic, standard, yet necessary **HTML structure and attributes** required for the component to function as intended. Some important points to consider:

- **Behavior should be abstracted from visual style.** Although CSS styles can influence behavior (for example, `display: block` and `display: inline` can force elements to behave in different ways), they should be avoided in this section. Classes may be considered required if they are necessary for JavaScript to identify and select functional elements. Just be sure to speak to the behavior _only_.

- **Do not assume JavaScript initialization or options are being set using `data` attributes**. Do not include any `data` attributes used by JavaScript in this section so long as these options can be passed to a class constructor. These attributes should not be mistaken as _required_. Document these attributes in the JavaScript API section.

Start with the fundamental requirements to get the most basic component to function, and then build from there. Create ***abbreviated*** code samples to illustrate the structure or relationship of elements and their attributes.

<br>

**Example:**

The tablist groups together tabs. In order for the JavaScript to orient itself properly, the tablist must be wrapped by a `<div>` with the class `tab-horizontal` like so:

```html
<div class="tab-horizontal">
  <div class="tab-group" role="tablist" aria-label="Required here">
    {tabs}
  </div>
</div>
```

<br>

For very complex components it may make sense to divide this content into sub-sections by differing functionality, HTML fragments, or both.

## Javascript usage

This section should be used to document how to interface with the component's JavaScript class or classes. When documenting multiple classes, create a section with a heading named for each class. For each class's section, repeat the following structure. For example:

- JavaScript usage
  - Tab
    - Initialization
    - Events
    - Static class methods
    - Instance methods
    - Instance properties
  - TabSlider
    - Initialization
    - Events
    - Static class methods
    - Instance methods
    - Instance properties

For components with a single class, do not nest documentation under an additional heading named for the class. For example:

- JavaScript usage
  - Initialization
  - Events
  - Static class methods
  - Instance methods
  - Instance properties

### Initialization

Start with the bare minimum "out-of-the-box" usage. Most components enable auto-initialization on page load by targeting a data attribute set on HTML elements. This should be documented first for developers who want to see a quick and easy "low-code" implementation before moving on to more advanced implementations. Provide an ***abbreviated*** code sample to demonstrate where to place the `data-mount` attribute.

Additionally, any option that can be set using a `data` attribute, should be listed in tabular format. The instance member that stores the value passed from a `data` attribute must be listed under the "Instance member" column. Precise values should be represented as strings for most HTML attributes, unless a boolean attribute (evaluated by its presence/absence) better communicates a boolean state where its omission is the default.

<br>

**Example:**

| Element | Attribute                       | Value                 | Instance member          | Required | Description                                                                        |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| form    | `data-mount`                    | `"validation"`        | `el`                     | yes*     | Initializes validation for the form.                                               |
| form    | `data-prevent-form-submission`  |                       | `preventFormSubmission`  | no       | Boolean attribute to prevent the form from submitting after successful validation. |
| form    | `data-allow-empty-submit`       | `"true"` \| `"false"` | `allowEmptySubmit`       | no       | Allow the form to submit when all fields are empty.                                |

\* **Attribute is required if using the auto-initialization method only! `data-` attributes are not recommended to be used otherwise and may result in unexpected behavior.**

<br>

Next, demonstrate how a developer can create a new instance of the component without using the auto-initialization feature. Provide a code sample showing the manual initialization of a component using a constructor.

```js
myDropdown = new mwf.Dropdown({
  el: document.querySelector('#dropdownId')
});
```

The constructor will likely have at least one required parameter (usually the `el` parameter). A complete list of both required and optional parameters must be documented using the table format below.

<br>

**Example:**

| Name        | Type          | Required | Default  | Description |
|-------------|---------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `el`        | `Node`        | yes      | `null`   | The element that toggles the dropdown. |
| `menu`      | `Node`        | no       | `null`   | The element that represents the dropdown menu. If not specified, looks for an element with associated `aria-controls` attribute. |
| `direction` | `String` enum | no       | `'down'` | Overrides the direction the dropdown opens. Accepts `'up'`, `'down'`, `'left'`, or `'right'`. Default direction is `down` unless a `dropup`, `dropleft`, or `dropright` class is found on the parent element. |

<br>

## Events

All components should have custom events built into them to allow for developers to add callback-like functionality when an instance of a component changes in some way. All custom events for a component must be documented using the table format below. Listing the events by name in alphabetical order is preferred.

<br>

**Example:**

| Event name  | Event target      | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `onHide`    | _instance_.`el`   | Dispatches when a menu becomes hidden. |
| `onRemove`  | _instance_.`el`   | Dispatches when a dropdown is removed. |
| `onShow`    | _instance_.`el`   | Dispatches when a menu becomes shown.  |
| `onUpdate`  | _instance_.`el`   | Dispatches when a dropdown is updated. |

<br>

Take special note of the column "Event target". This is the element the event must be bound to, which in this case can be referenced as the instance variable `el`. Whenever referring to a property found on an instance, use `instance` as the placeholder for the variable pointing to the object reference. All event targets must be instance members of a component.

## Static methods and instance methods

The format for documenting static methods and instance methods are virtually the same. However, it is important the divide these two types of methods into separate sections, as the usage is very different and should not be easily confused. Always present the "Static methods" section first with "Instance methods" immediately following to maintain a consistent order to JavaScript documentation.

For both static and instance methods, list each method as a sub-heading in the format `methodName()`. These headings should be organized in alphabetical order within their respective sections. Under each heading, briefly describe what the method does.

If the method accepts parameters, these must be documented using the table format below.

The value provided under the "Type" column must be a JavaScript type or interface. If more than one type or interface is expected, separate the values with a pipe (e.g. `String` \| `Number`).

<br>

**Example:**

| Params              | Type                  | Required  | Default | Description |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `setFocus`          | `Boolean`             | no        | `false` | Flags whether focus should be set to triggering element. |
| `opts`              | `Object`              | no        | `{}`    | An object containing configuration options. |
| `opts.placement`    | `String` enum         | no        | `null`  |The new placement for the menu. Accepts `'up'`, `'down'`, `'left'`, or `'right'`. |
| `opts.alignment`    | `String` enum         | no        | `null`  | The new alignment for the menu. Accepts `'start'`, `'end'`, or `'center'`. |
| `opts.offset`       | `String` \| `Number`  | no        | `null`  | The new menu offset in pixels. |
| `opts.enableReflow` | `Boolean`             | no        | `null`  | Whether the menu should auto-adjust positioning based on window real estate. |

<br>

Additionally, if the method returns a value, use the below table format to document the expected return value.

<br>

**Example:**

| Returns   | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Array`   | An array of all current instantiated dropdowns. |

<br>

>The above tables are essentially table-formatted JavaScript code documentation block comments. Refer to the block comments above your method definitions for this information, or to [JSDoc](https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/) for further reading.

## Instance properties

Finally, document all publicly available instance properties. A complete list must be documented using the table format below.

The value provided under the "Type" column must be a JavaScript type or interface. If more than one type or interface is expected, separate the values with a pipe (e.g. `String` \| `Number`).

<br>

**Example:**

| Name                | Type        | Description             |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| `arrowDirection`    | `String`    | Direction of last arrow pressed, either `left` or `right`, defaults to `left`. |
| `arrowNext`         | `Node`      | Next arrow button (right in left-to-right pages). |
| `arrowOffsetWidth`  | `Number`    | Width in px of how much to adjust for each arrow button. |
| `arrowPrev`         | `Node`      | Previous arrow button (left in left-to-right pages). |
| `arrows`            | `Node`      | The parent element of the arrow buttons. |
| `el`                | `Node`      | The base element of the instance, and the outermost wrapper .|
| `events`            | `Array`     | An array of objects describing the event listeners and handlers added by this instance. |

<br>
