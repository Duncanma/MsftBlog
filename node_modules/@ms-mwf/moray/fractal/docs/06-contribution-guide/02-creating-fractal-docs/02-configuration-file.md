Every component in Fractal has context. Context is defined in the component's Fractal configuration file, `{component-name}.config.json`.

## JSON formatting

Always use Kebab case for JSON properties within your configuration file. Fractal has standardized on using Kebab case for folder structure, so it makes sense to stick to one case convention for anything Fractal specific. Indentation should also follow the JavaScript Standard Style of 2 spaces.

## Default context

Every component should have a default context. This is defined on the "context" key of the configuration object within the component's configuration JSON file.

```json
{
  "context": {
    "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

The properties within this context are then referenced in the handlebars file like so:

```hbs
<div>\{{foo}}</div>
```

The properties within the context object should not be namespaced or wrapped by a single object at the top level. This will complicate how context is passed and scoped when rendering as a sub-component within another component.

**\*\*DON'T\*\***

```json
{
  "context": {
    "component-namespace": {
      "foo": "bar"
    }
  }
}
```

If the component has multiple variants, the default context will be inherited by all variants, where each variant can add to or override context properties. A "default" variant should always be included that simply inherits the entirety of the default context. This default variant should have a `name` only. All subsequent variants must have a `name` and a `context` defined.

```json
{
  "context": {
    "foo": "bar"
  },
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "default"
    },
    {
      "name": "new-variant",
      "context": {
        "foo": "Hello",
        "baz": "World!"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

Corresponding handlebars template:

```hbs
<div>\{{foo}} \{{baz}}</div>
```

Rendered HTML for `default` variant:

```html
<div>bar </div>
```

Rendered HTML for `new-variant`:

```html
<div>Hello World!</div>
```
