MWF supports the **latest, stable releases** of all major browsers and platforms. On Windows, **we support Internet Explorer 11 and both the old and new (Chromium) Microsoft Edge**.

> **Note:** For Internet Explorer 11 support, the provided JavaScript polyfills **must be loaded** as described in the [example page structure]({{ internalLink '/docs/page-structure' }}).

You can find our supported range of browsers and their versions [in our .browserslistrc file](https://mscomdev.visualstudio.com/Moray/_git/moray-configs?path=%2Fpackages%2Fbrowserslist-config%2Findex.js).

## Mobile devices

Generally speaking, MWF supports the latest versions of each major platform’s default browsers. Note that proxy browsers (such as Opera Mini, Opera Mobile’s Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini, Amazon Silk) may be supported but are not tested and support is not guaranteed.

## Polyfills

MWF bundles the following polyfills separately from our main JavaScript bundle. This file must be loaded for Internet Explorer 11 support, but it is recommended for all sites unless only modern browser support is required.

- [dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4): Standard API for DOM manipulation (DOM Level 4)
- [picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill): `<picture>` element and `srcset` attribute for responsive images
- [intersection-observer](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/main/polyfill): Intersection Observer API
- [smoothscroll-polyfill](https://github.com/iamdustan/smoothscroll): `scroll-behavior` CSS property

Additionally, because we write "modern" JavaScript (ES2015 and later), we use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transcompile our JavaScript into a format that our supported browsers can understand. As part of our build process, Babel injects additional polyfills into our main JavaScript bundle to support various language features as needed.
