## NPM package installation

MWF/Moray is distributed as a private npm package. If you are a Microsoft vendor or third-party, you may need to be added to the [Moray project](https://mscomdev.visualstudio.com/Moray) in Azure DevOps in order to authenticate with the feed.

1. Add the Moray npm feed credentials to your user `.npmrc` file:
  - Navigate to [Moray package feed](https://mscomdev.visualstudio.com/Moray/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=Moray)
  - Click the "Connect to feed" button and follow the instructions in the npm tab

2. In the same folder as your project's `package.json`, create a file called `.npmrc` and add this to it:

```bash
@ms-mwf:registry=https://mscomdev.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/Moray/npm/registry/
always-auth=true
```

3. Install the package and save it to your project's dependencies by running

`npm install @ms-mwf/moray --save`
