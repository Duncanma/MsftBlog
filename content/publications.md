description: A list of writing on technical and gaming topics. Definitely incomplete, and some links are broken, but I tried to add as much as I could track down
---

Back when I was living in Canada, before I started working at Microsoft, I discovered that I really enjoyed writing. I was doing a lot of developer training, travelling around the US and Canada teaching week long courses covering Access, Visual Basic, Architecture, SQL, and more. I started to reach out to some publishers, pitching some technical book ideas and getting a few chapter and book assignments sent back to me from various places. I ended up writing a few books, but I eventually moved teams at Microsoft and took a job as a full-time writer. I would write small articles, explaining a concept, going through the code, and hopefully inspiring some folks to try it out for themselves. I don't know how many articles I've written, but I do know that I used to try to write 1-2 a week. At the same time, I was actively blogging (first on a site called blogs.msdn.com, but eventually moving to my own domain), with a similar focus on coding concepts, sample code and a ton of link sharing. Other than internal documents, this blog is my only real writing these days. I come up with book ideas from time to time, and I have many article ideas, but the combination of writing on my own property and not having to commit to something as large as a book means that a blog post every month or so is just about right.

My most recent print publication was a single 'article' in the book "[97 Things Every Cloud Engineer Should Know](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9781492076728/)", a quick intro to the idea of scalability.

## Books

As I mentioned, I was involved in a lot of books, and I don't have a full recollection of them all. I would receive a copy of every book, sometimes one in every language it was translated to, but I recently decided there wasn't a lot of reason to keep them around and I took a few boxes of them into a local used bookstore. Hopefully they weren't so old that no one will find them useful. Doing a bit of internet sleuthing, here is a list of the books I've written, starting with the most recent.

- Zune For Dummies (with Brian Johnson and Harvey Chute) -- 2007
- Xbox 360 For Dummies (also with Brian Johnson) -- 2006
- Kickstart: Microsoft Visual Basic .NET 2003 (with Andy Baron, Erik Porter and Joel Semeniuk) -- 2003
- Teach Yourself Visual Basic .NET in 21 Days (with Kent Sharkey) -- 2001
- Exchange and Outlook: Constructing Collaborative Solutions (with Joel Semeniuk) -- 2000
- Word 2000 VBA Programmer's Reference (with Felipe Martins) -- 1999

I wrote a few chapters for many books as well, but I could only find a couple of those listed on Amazon. Essentially Wrox, SAMS, QUE, or another publisher would reach out and ask if I could write some section of a book. I remember doing 3 chapters on data access in Visual Basic for example, and they would just use that to fill gaps in another author's book. The couple I could find...

## Articles

Since it was my job, I wrote a lot of articles for the MSDN website, but I also wrote for a few other websites 'on the side' and I ended up writing quite a few for MSDN Magazine (a print publication, that was related to the MSDN site, but always felt like a bigger deal to be published in because they had more limited space). Unrelated to programming, I also signed up for a year or so, to write the Xbox Dad column on xbox.com. This was a series of articles about gaming with kids, which I was quickly becoming an expert in with my two children. Many of the articles I've written are now gone off the internet, which is sad, but part of the danger of publishing onto other people's domains.

- [Advanced Basics: Creating A Breadcrumb Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/cc163764) Hansel and Gretel had the right idea when they followed the pebbles that glistened there like newly minted coins, showing them the way. ” The deeper you get into the forest or into your data, the more likely you are going to need help to find your way back out again.

The My language extensions take the idea of helper functions to a whole new level because they include so much functionality out of the box. Called “a speed-dial for the .NET Framework” by the author, the My extensions are a feature you won’t want to overlook. Duncan Mackenzie – May 2004
