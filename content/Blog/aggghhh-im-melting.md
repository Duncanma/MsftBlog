_or am I being scribbled?_

I just noticed that the staged version of the VB developer center (our pre-production version where we publish the site prior to pushing it live) has [Brad's](http://blogs.msdn.com/brad_mccabe/) picture and blog on the home page... making this my last post that will show up on [that page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic) ðŸ™‚

Of course, my blog isn't going away, but you get to look at someone else's face and commentary on MSDN instead of me! It's been fun though, and hopefully useful or at least entertaining to a few of you VB developers out there too ðŸ™‚
