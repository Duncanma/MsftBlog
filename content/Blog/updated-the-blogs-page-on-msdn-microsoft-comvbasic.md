I haven't taken into account [the comments to Paul Vick's request for VB bloggers](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2004/06/01/1123.aspx), but the page has been updated a bit based on my own list of folks that blog about VB.

[Check it out here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/community/blogs/default.aspx).
