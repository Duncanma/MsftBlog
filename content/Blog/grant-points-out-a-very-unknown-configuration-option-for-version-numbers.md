title: Grant points out a very unknown configuration option for version numbers...
type: posts
---
In a very 'Easter-Egg-ish' post, [Grant Richins](http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri) (a developer on the C# Compiler Team), explains a configuration option of 'alink.dll'.

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

    _So everybody hopefully knows you can put a star "*" for either of the last 2 version numbers of the AssemblyVersion attribute.  ALink will then translate that into the days and minutes since January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2000.  Well, here comes the feature: What if you don't like January 1<sup>st</sup> 2000?  Well, you can change it._

Personally, this seems of dubious worth, which might explain the lack of documentation, but if this option is useful to you, [check out his post for all the details](http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/archive/2004/04/13/112837.aspx).
