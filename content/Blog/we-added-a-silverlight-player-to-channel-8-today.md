title: We added a Silverlight player to Channel 8 today
type: posts
---


We used a modified version of one of the templates that ships with [Expression Media Encoder](http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/overview.aspx?key=media) as our player... and [channel 8](http://channel8.msdn.com/) has become the first of our sites (which include [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com), [Channel 10](http://on10.net), [VisitMix.com](http://VisitMix.com) and more) to have a Silverlight video player on them. And, below here, you can see that player embedded into this blog post...



Note that I had to remove the 'scrubbing bar' due to some odd bug around releasing the mouse after scrubbing was completed... but we'll figure that out and get it back in as soon as we can. Check out the video above back in its home on C9.... [check out the video from above on on Channel 8](http://channel8.msdn.com/Posts/4/), and [build your own player using those templates](http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2007/09/11/expression-encoder-custom-templates.aspx)!
