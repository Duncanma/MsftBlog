title: Sure it is about Zip Compression, but it is also about a whole lot more...

[This recent MSDN magazine article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/06/ZipCompression/) is pretty cool. Although the title suggests it is all about Zip Compression, the real power of this article is that it points out that the J# libraries are available from **any .NET language**, providing your C#/VB.NET apps with a lot more than just zip support (although that is pretty neat too).
