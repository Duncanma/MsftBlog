title: Lead Developer position available with MSDN
type: posts

Just posted recently, there is a opening at MSDN for a "Software Development Engineering Lead". This is within the same group that I have just joined and it looks like a great job for the right person. Here is a brief snippet from the [full job description](http://www.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=2e310b8d-a7ca-4105-b7bd-fcaf8eee5054)....

> Come leverage state-of-the-art technology! The MSDN/TechNet development team is looking for you to help us innovate in many exciting areas for our Development and IT Professional communities.
>
> We are looking for seasoned Development Lead that can deliver and strategize our tooling for Content Management, Personalization, Rendering and Publishing efforts. This is highly collaborative position and you will be working closely with the teams that we depend on (for example the Assistance Platform and the Microsoft.com Platform teams) to integrate and couple our tools to a variety of backend systems and aggregating data sources.
>
> We have a broad charter for content publishing, tooling and workflow applications for our core audiences and the broader areas of Microsoft.com and for all of our worldwide subsidiaries. We will highly value your expertise in areas of locale specific publishing, site personalization and content targeting. We want to improve the relevance of our content and site experiences for our customers by providing personalized and targeted content. Familiarity and experience with RSS, meta-data and taxonomies in relationship to application development will be important to this role.

Based on the response to past job postings, I'd like to be clear about one thing... **do not submit your resume to me, do not post it in the comments to this blog entry** ... either approach will basically be ignored (unless you are someone who knows me well enough that you are looking for a reference).
