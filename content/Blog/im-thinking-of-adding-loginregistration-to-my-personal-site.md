title: I'm thinking of adding login/registration to my personal site...
type: posts

Not sure what scenarios this will be used to enable in the long run, but I might play around with some web services (with authentication) and a few 'prototypes' for articles and MSDN features that I've been musing about...

  * Do you run a personal site?
  * Do you have any form of authentication?
  * What do you use to handle it (I'm planning Forms Authentication against SQL Server)?
  * What do you use it for?

this is for <http://www.duncanmackenzie.net> ... which is quickly becoming my little sandbox for asp.net code ðŸ™‚
