Writing [my last post](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/archive/2004/02/20/77513.aspx) started me thinking about the **C64**... and I found [this page](http://uk.geocities.com/magoos_universe/64_intro.htm) detailing software releases over the years the C64 was hot (really, it was...)

I can remember PaperClip was my word processor, Bard's Tale I and II were my pastime.... and Gary Kitchen's Game Construction Kit was my hobby... yep, very cool stuff. And to think, I don't have it anymore... hmm... I should go fire up the Intellivision.
