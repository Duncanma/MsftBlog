type: posts
---
Kent's first day with my group (to avoid confusion: "my group" means the group I belong to, I don't manage anyone...) and he has already realized the truth about us.

<font face="Arial" color="teal">"Day 1 â€“ spent most of it in the cafeteria, as it was a move day. Two meetings (much lower than my day would have been). Yes, my new team is/are lunatics ðŸ˜‰ (_They know that already, and yes, I know they all read this_)" â€“ [<font face="Arial" color="teal">Kent Sharkey's Blog](http://dotnetweblogs.com/ksharkey/posts/4245.aspx)

For those of you who might be wondering, Kent has just joined [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com), and more specifically he has become the ASP.NET Content Strategist. As a group, we content strategists are involved in planning out the articles (and other materials) that MSDN should write, link to and/or acquire around various development technologies. I'm the Visual Basic Content Strategist, Steve Kirk is our man on [Architecture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture), Matt Powell covers the exciting world of [Web Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices), [Frank Redmond ](http://www.google.com/search?num=30&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=Frank+Redmond+site%3Amsdn.microsoft.com&btnG=Google+Search)is all over the .NET Framework, [Brian Johnson](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735618747/qid=1048583643/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_5/102-2505337-1511315?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) just joined us as the Security strategist, [Paul Johns ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnguinet/html/drguinetnhp.asp)is working with something called C#, and [Shawn Morrissey](http://dotnetweblogs.com/shawnmor/) (our boss) covers Visual Studio... oh yeah, [Tim Ewald](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tewald/default.aspx) is also part of our group... but no one really knows [what he does](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/WebServices/) ðŸ˜‰
