If you have digital cable from Comcast, including HD service, then go up into the 600's and try to find the new Universal HD channel. Repeats of shows like Firefly, Battlestar Galatica (new series, not old), The Equalizer, Knight Rider... and tons more, all in HD. I watched an episode of Firefly last night in HD and it was wonderful!
