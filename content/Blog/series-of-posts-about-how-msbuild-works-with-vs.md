Neil Enns of the MSBuild team has released the first of a series of posts about how MSBuild works within Visual Studio, how VS projects are used by MSBuild and basically everything you'd want to know about how the two systems interact.

You can check out all the entries [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/msbuild/archive/category/11233.aspx), in order from most recent to oldest, as they are posted.
