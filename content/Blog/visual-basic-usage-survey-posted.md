The VB team is interested in collecting some stats about how you use VB, so I put a simple survey up for them at [http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/visualbasicsurvey/](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/visualbasicsurvey/), feel free to check it out if you are interested in providing information...

_For whoever is interested, I used the [http://www.nsurvey.org/](http://www.nsurvey.org/) software to create this survey..._
