title: Added Atom support to the FlairMaker... my version at least
type: posts
---
Nick, from "[The Coding Monkey](http://thecodingmonkey.blogspot.com)" mentioned that he would like to see Atom support in the [FlairMaker](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/10/15/3101.aspx), so ... having no real reason not to, and having an extra 15 minutes after the kids went to sleep before I started cleaning up the house, I added it...

Of course, I've just added this to my forked version of [Kent's original code](http://www.acmebinary.com/blogs/kent/archive/2005/10/07/273.aspx)... so any feature I add that he likes will need to manually added into his version... bad software development practice, but hey we're just playing around here so you should be expecting too much.

**Update:** I also modified the code to pull the blog's title from the feed (Atom or RSS) and stick it at the bottom. Not that useful of a feature for the Coding 4 Fun version, since it is always pointing at the same feed... but useful for mine if people want to use it for their own feeds
