title: 'Atari CEO: No PS3 games before 2007 â€“ Joystiq'

I was surprised early to hear that God of War II was a PS2 game... and now [this](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/02/atari-ceo-no-atari-ps3-games-before-2007/)? I think it just the price that is scaring developers... scary to develop for a console that **seems** out of the price range of your target audience. I say "seems" because despite my own (biased) negative thoughts about the PS3, I expect it to be a pretty impressive machine... one that quite a few people will pick up. I do agree with other people's predictions that it will lag behind the 360, the $$ will see to that, but I don't think anyone expects it to flop...

I don't think I'll end up getting a PS2 though, as tempting as it is at the low-low refurbished prices you can find it at now; the idea was to pick up a used one and an EyeToy and then try to lose some weight playing Kinetic... but all that work for one game seems like a bad idea. Instead I need to find some way to do some mild exercise while playing **any** game on my 360. It wouldn't be instead of my normal exercise routine, but every little bit counts. A recumbent exercise bike seems like a possible solution, although I don't think my wife wants one in our living room.
