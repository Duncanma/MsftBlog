I was considering adding one (or more) of the many aggregator-buttons (subscribe to this feed in newsgator, add this feed to your MSN start page, etc.) when I found this, one button that handles all of the most popular aggregators through a single link.

[<img alt="subscribe to this feed" src="http://images.solosub.com/feed_button.gif" border="0" />](http://solosub.com/sub/http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/rss.aspx "Subscribe to this Feed")

Check out [http://solosub.com](http://solosub.com) for more info...
