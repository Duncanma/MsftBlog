title: Releasing binaries for my samples
type: posts
---
Since starting my [column](http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/codefun.asp), I've received quite a few requests for "just the install" from people who read the article, liked the app I built, but don't have any interest in the code... they just want to run the app!

I never really considered that possibility, and in some cases I didn't even write the code with that in mind, but now I'm wondering if I should at least provide a built install file in with the downloadable code sample for non-programmers... weird thought. Whatever I do, I can't support people who use the sample without compiling it themselves... the code sample is merely a way to show some interesting concept(s), I try to make the applications interesting but they certainly aren't the point.
