type: posts

If you've been reading my blog for awhile, you probably know about [my column "Coding4Fun"](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/), well now there is an entire site on MSDN going by that name... to be clear, this is not a site all about my column ðŸ™‚ ... it is a site dedicated to the same concept though, hobbyist coding.

Check it out at: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun)

**Update:** way more details on the site available [at Dan's blog...](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/04/17/409116.aspx)
