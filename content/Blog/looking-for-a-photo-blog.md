title: Looking for a "Photo Blog"
type: posts
---
I recently acquired a digital camera so I started thinking about a photo blog... something my family out in Winnipeg could subscribe to. A colleague, who has a camera phone, suggested textamerica, which seemed quite happy to accept my registration but I didn't go through with the sign up because it seemed that they only intended camera **phone** users on their site, and I didn't want to mess with their system...

Can anyone recommend a good place to post digital photos that makes it easy for family to view [the latest pic(s)](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/pics/) without too much hassle? I'm not looking for long-term or hi-quality storage here, I can handle that on my own site, but I was hoping for something simple where I could hold a rotating set of 10-20 pics...

Of course, I could just build up some pages on my own web site for this purpose, but I like the simplicity of photo blogs, even being able to email the pics up to the site is a great simplification over posting them to my own site.
