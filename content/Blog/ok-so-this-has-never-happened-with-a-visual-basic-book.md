[ <img src="http://gadgetmodels.i4u.com/gallery/April_2006/xbox_360_model_1.jpg" height="168" width="120" align="left" /> ](http://gadgetmodels.i4u.com/gadget_photo_model_April_20060.html)I've remarked to a few people that writing a more 'consumer' focused book has been quite different from my usual area of writing (covering programming topics mostly), but [this takes the cake](http://spaces.msn.com/brianjo/blog/cns!57C723EC58B8F3A3!964.entry?_c11_blogpart_blogpart=blogview&#038;_c=blogpart#permalink).

Gadget Models, a site that seems to combine the two popular topics of models and technology, has run [a feature that includes our book](http://gadgetmodels.i4u.com/gadget_photo_model_April_20060.html). Sadly, we weren't at all involved. Note to anyone who is worried about the content of the site itself, I didn't look through it all but it doesn't seem to cross into nudity or anything like that...

On another note, I just got back tonight from a week's vacation... a vacation that included a lot of sleep and even some reading (of actual books), but no Xbox 360 and almost no email... so tonight I'm hoping to get back on with Oblivion!
