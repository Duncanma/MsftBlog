I blogged about it before, but there is a 15-part webcast series starting Tuesday February 3rd, presented by [Dr. Joe Hummel](http://www.develop.com/us/technology/bio.aspx?id=9), focused on Visual Basic .NET topics for the Visual Basic 6.0 developer (and others!).

Check out all the details [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/community/webcasts/modern/default.aspx)!
