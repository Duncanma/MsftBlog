For anyone who is interested in using the code behind this site for their own blog, or who just finds reading code to be a fun pastime, you can go to [http://www.codeplex.com/oxite](http://www.codeplex.com/oxite "http://www.codeplex.com/oxite") to check it out. Of course, there are other blog engines up there, including [blog engine .NET](http://dotnetblogengine.net/Default.aspx) (which appears to be very highly supported and recommended by many folks), if you are in the market for some free blogging code.
