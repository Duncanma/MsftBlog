title: Major revamp of the VB Community page up...
type: posts
---
Ok, so here's the scoop... [Robert Green, the Visual Basic PM focused on Community](http://blogs.msdn.com/rgreen_msft), is going to be in charge of [the /community portion of the VB developer center on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/community/default.aspx) from now on... updating it, designing it, blogging about it, etc....

What does this mean?

Well, for one thing it means a big change in content today, but it also means much more frequent updates and a ton of VB community information available from one place.
