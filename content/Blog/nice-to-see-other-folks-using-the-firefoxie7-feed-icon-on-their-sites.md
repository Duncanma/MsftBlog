Found the [Media Center Sandbox](http://blog.mediacentersandbox.com/PermaLink,guid,817c2b05-2a9e-47ac-80c9-1c4db5b26c18.aspx) today, via [Erik Porter](http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter), and it is nice to see them using [the newly blessed icon](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/12/30/3447.aspx). I'd suggest they use a smaller one though, and update the feed icon next to their blogroll to be consistent... but otherwise its great ðŸ™‚
