title: Yay! I have an Xbox 360!!

Ok, you'll be glad to hear that I won't be whining any more about not having an Xbox 360. My pre-order from EB Games **still** hasn't come in, but a friend of mine knew someone who had waited in line to get a 360 on launch day and then had their pre-order come in... so they were willing to sell me their second Xbox 360 at cost. Lucky me, I picked it up yesterday and took it home, then set it up after the kids were in bed. So far, all I've done is play Hexic and Gauntlet, and download a bunch of movie trailers (in 720p, sweet!). I have DOA 4, so that will be the next thing to try whenever I have time... then I need to figure out what game will be my next acquisition. #1 and #2 on [my "list"](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/11/05/3206.aspx) aren't out yet, so ... probably Kameo?
