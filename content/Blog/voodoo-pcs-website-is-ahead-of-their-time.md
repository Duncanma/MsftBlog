title: Voodoo PC's website is ahead of their time...

Hitting this page ([http://www.voodoopc.com/showroom.aspx?productID=1076](http://www.voodoopc.com/showroom.aspx?productID=1076)) with IE7 produces several javascript alerts letting me know that I'm running an "Old Browser". Now, I'm assuming that this is a bug in their version detection code, but even so... is that what they show to someone running Netscape 4 or IE 5... "Old Browser" ? Odd....
