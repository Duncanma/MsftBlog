Earlier today I posted some background pics... including some from [Dolomites World](www.dolomitesworld.com)... Frank Redmond (Content Strategist for .NET Framework) just bust out laughing in my office because he thought I was posting backgrounds based on one of the many wonderful Dolemite films...

I wasn't... but now Frank is bringing in a selection of movies for me to watch, as it seems that my cultural education is severely lacking in the "martial arts blaxploitation comedy" category
