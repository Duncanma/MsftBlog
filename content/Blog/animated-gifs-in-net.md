title: Animated Gifs in .NET
type: posts
---
I hadn't noticed that the graphic classes in .NET had built-in support for animated gifs, but [a recent GDN post](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/Thread.aspx?id=180291) shows how you can grab the individual frames out of a GIF and display them one at a time... I think you would have to find out the intended delay between frames to produce the author's desired result, but I'm not positive as it has been awhile since I made an animated gif ðŸ™‚
