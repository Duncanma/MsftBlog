[Paul Vick](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/) (Technical Lead on the VB team and author of [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321169514/duncanmackenz-20)) provides a list of key VB sessions scheduled for the upcoming TechEd conference... and his schedule for the week.

**I'll be there** too... and I'll post my schedule whenever I figure it out, but in general if you come by the VB Cabana (don't ask me where that is, I'll figure out on registration day) I'll probably be hanging out.
