Looking at [this map](http://virtualearth.msn.com/default.aspx?cp=47.665404|-122.165708&style=h&lvl=18&v=1), my first thought was "I wonder if this will lead to businesses cleaning their roof?", but then capitalism took over and I thought "hey, people could put ads on big roofs like that... it would be cool!"
