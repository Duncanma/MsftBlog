title: VB Futures section up on MSDN...

Now, to me, VB 2005 is the "future", and anything beyond that is really just coffee-break information to read briefly.... but I guess I wouldn't be a very good Microsoft person if I didn't start pushing the version-after-next version of our development tools **before the next version has even shipped**.

So, with that in mind, check out [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/future/](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/future/) which, despite my comments, is quite a good pile of info on post-Whidbey VB features and even includes a download to bring LINQ features in VB 2005. Hmm... ok, I guess with that download it seems a bit more 'current' to me ... hmph...
