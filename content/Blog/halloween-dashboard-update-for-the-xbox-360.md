Have you seen [this list of features](http://www.unscripted360.com/2006/10/30/xbox-360-fall-system-update/)?

Absolutely crazy list... my favorites (lots of them are great, but these are ones that either I had already been wishing for or that I know will be a big deal to me):

  * Stream WMV video from a Windows PC running Windows Media Player 11, Zune software, or Windows Media Connect.
  * Play video from storage devices such as USB flash drives, Xbox 360 Memory Units, etc.
  * Play video from CD or DVD data discs.
      * Xbox 360 Wireless Headset support, including battery level indicator in the Xbox Guide.
      * Set up automatic downloads of newly released Xbox Live Arcade trial games.
      * Optionally disable notifications from Xbox Live while watching DVD movies (I've turned notifications off across the board because of this)</ul>
    You really need to see the [full list of updates](http://www.unscripted360.com/2006/10/30/xbox-360-fall-system-update/) though, this is a big release (1080p support folks... free... tomorrow... not in my favorites list because I don't have a TV that supports it... but if you do, rock on).
