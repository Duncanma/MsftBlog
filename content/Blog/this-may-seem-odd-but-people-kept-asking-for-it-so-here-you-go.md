On the various programming forums I read, a common question is "how can I find out the IP address of my router"... for whatever reason (and there certainly are a few reasons that I can think of) people were really looking for their IP address on the Internet. In general, the solution was to hit one of a few publically available sites out there that display your IP when you view their web pages and then scrape the IP address back out of the HTML. Simple enough, but I thought I would make it simpler for anyone who needed this solution by creating [a quick and simple web service](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/Services).
