title: Need blogging solution for spouse
type: posts
---
My wife read my blog for the first time yesterday, and she has decided that she wants to try it for herself... but where to blog? dotnetweblogs is great, but this isn't going to be a tech-focused blog (is there a mommyblogs.com?). I have my own site, it even runs ASP.NET but I doubt I can do much (if anything at all) with the server config as it is running on a shared server. Is there a good blogging engine that doesn't require much on the server end other than file access? Can I use [w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/) against it? Hmm... I need help folks.

It turns out there is a [momblogs.com](http://momblogs.com), but I'm not sure they actually offer any blog services...
