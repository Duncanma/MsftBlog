title: Long overdue, but here is the source for the "blog copier"
type: posts
---
In [my first post on this site](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/08/25/589.aspx), I mentioned an application that I wrote to copy blog posts from one .Text server to another. Overall, I didn't think the application had any real use after the web service I used was removed from the weblogs.asp.net servers, but I'm posting it anyway for anyone who might find it useful.
