Landed in Vegas for the [conference](http://www.devconnections.com/shows/aspfall2005/default.asp?s=65), talk is on Thursday.... I'll be talking about [MSDN2.microsoft.com](http://msdn2.microsoft.com), but more specifically I'll be covering the use of the Virtual Page Provider feature in ASP.NET 2.0, so if that type of thing appeals to you, come by and check it out!
