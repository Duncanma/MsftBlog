If you are looking for Aero/Glass style icons... check out [http://www.vistaico.com/](http://www.vistaico.com/ "http://www.vistaico.com/")

This is a spin-off site from [http://www.vistaicons.com/](http://www.vistaicons.com/ "http://www.vistaicons.com/") where you can find a few more icons... I'm still trying to find the money side of this (I'm assuming you give away good icons to lead to a purchase of more? But I can't find any to buy...) so let me know if you figure it out.
