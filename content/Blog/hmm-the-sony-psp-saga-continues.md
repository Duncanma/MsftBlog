title: Hmm... the Sony PSP saga continues

Update on [the bricked PSP](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2006/07/01/5634.aspx)... So I spoke to a someone at the local Sony retail store... $120 (CDN) to fix the PSP. Keeping in mind that all that my nephew did was turn it off when he saw a dialog he didn't understand, that is a lot of money. I'm especially unhappy because I know that this must be a common issue and a simple fix (open it up, flash the chips to the factory default firmware and then maybe re-update to the latest firmware... all simple procedures, but ones that only Sony can do once the machine refuses to start up).
