It appears to work fine... assuming you haven't voted from the machine you are currently on, you should be able to see the new button (and try it out) at <http://www.duncanmackenzie.net>

Currently, [Halo 2](http://www.bungie.net/games/halo2/Default.aspx) appears to be behind VS 2005... which was not what I expected ðŸ™‚

Let me know if you have any problems, I'm planning a larger series of updates to the control, but that won't be for a couple of days...
