title: Still in Seattle, but hopeful...

I'm still at SeaTac, but I've given up on my flight to LA (which could turn out to be a mistake, but at this point... it isn't a big risk) and I have a seat on a flight to another city in California (Palm Springs)... then it is time to rent a vehicle and head for LA... should be an interesting night. While I'm sitting here, I've been getting updates from a variety of MSFT folks who are here, those who are already in LA... and those that are stuck in other cities. Kent is stuck in Portland... Mike Amundsen is on his way to the airport, with hope but not guaranteed of anything into LAX... Andy Oakley is going to go to to Palm Springs with me and another couple of MSDN folks. Should be interesting.

Talked to Brian Johnson, who is already in LA, and he asked me the most important question to ask when someone is stuck in an airport for hours...

And, yes... yes I do!
