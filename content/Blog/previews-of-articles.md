title: Previews of articles...
type: posts
---
A couple of weeks ago I posted [my "Quick Poll" Coding 4 Fun column](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun08032004.asp) in its unedited form... was that useful?

If it was, I can continue to do that with my articles ... basically posting my version of them up in advance onto [www.duncanmackenzie.net](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net) and then redirecting that to the real article once it ends up on MSDN.
