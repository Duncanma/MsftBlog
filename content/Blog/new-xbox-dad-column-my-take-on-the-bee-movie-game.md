If you or your kids are all excited about the upcoming Bee Movie with Jerry Seinfeld, then you should definitely check out [my latest article on Xbox.com](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/xboxdad/2007/1026-beemovie.htm). Along with the movie, an Xbox 360 game is also on its way.... and a demo is already up on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Not the most representative demo (more on that in the article!), but still fun and the game promises even more.
