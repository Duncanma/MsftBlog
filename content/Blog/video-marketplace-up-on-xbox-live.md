You can also hit it directly from the **Media blade**->**Video Marketplace.** If you have any questions, hit this_ [<u>_FAQ_</u>](http://forums.xbox.com/8324575/ShowPost.aspx) _or this_ [<u>_FAQ_</u>](http://forums.xbox.com/8324603/ShowPost.aspx) _on the Xbox forums. It’s fitting that on the Xbox 360’s first birthday, it becomes the first gaming console in history to provide HD TV shows and movies directly to your gaming lair...._
