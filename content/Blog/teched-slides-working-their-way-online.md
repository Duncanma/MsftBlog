type: posts

I'm slowly getting the TechEd slides up and onto MSDN... [the first few for VB are up here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/community/events/TechEd/), [SQL's are here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/sql/teched)... and more are coming _very soon now_ for C#, C++, ASP.NET and others...

<div class="media">
  ([Listening To](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun04252003.asp): The Darkest One [[The Tragically Hip](http://www.windowsmedia.com/mg/search.asp?srch=The+Tragically+Hip) / In Violet Light])
