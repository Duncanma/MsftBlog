Sampy and I stopped by the main doors of [PAX](http://www.on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/5132/) last night around 1am and there was already two groups of folks waiting. Some guys from Detroit were first in line, having come in by train earlier that day, and they covered the full range of video gaming interests (although no one in their group was into tabletop gaming, the other major side to PAX) with one big Nintendo fan, an Xbox lover, and a PC gamer ðŸ™‚

Luckily for the folks waiting, some of the PAX people stopped by with a free case of [BAWLS](http://www.bawls.com/), giving them vital caffeine to make it through the night!
