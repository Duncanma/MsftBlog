title: Weird Gathering of MSDNers at theme parks...
type: posts

[Chris just got back from Disney, Sea World, etc](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1207)... [Brian](http://weblogs.asp.net/brianjo/) heads there (Disneyworld in his case) this weekend, the site manager for C#, Amy, is going to Disneyland this weekend.... and I'm heading [there](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/dlr/landing/parkDLP) next week...

All this, and nary a mention of the mouse from anyone on my team in my last two years at MSDN.

Seem Odd? I'm very suspicious.
