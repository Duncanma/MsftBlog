title: Just got into Las Vegas, eBay and PayPal conference here I come...
type: posts

I just got to my hotel (the Aladdin) here in Vegas; ready to roam around the conferences looking for folks to film for [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com) (or [10](http://on10.net), if the topic fits). Hmm... Vegas and a video camera... could be trouble. ðŸ™‚

If you are in town, email me or call me at the hotel, especially if you have an idea about something to film!
