title: Removing Word's Formatting from text before pasting into .Text or other apps...
type: posts
---
The age-old question of 'how do I avoid putting funky Office HTML into my blog postings' came up on an internal email list today, and one of the answers was a pointer to [http://stevemiller.net/PureText/](http://stevemiller.net/PureText/), which I had never heard of... but it looks cool!

> _"Have you ever copied some text from a web page, a word document, help, etc., and wanted to paste it as simple text into another application without getting all the formatting from the original source? PureText makes this simple. Just copy/cut whatever you want to the clipboard, click on the PureText tray icon, and then paste to any application. Better yet, you can configure a Hot-Key to convert and paste the text for you. The pasted text will be pure and free from all formatting."_
