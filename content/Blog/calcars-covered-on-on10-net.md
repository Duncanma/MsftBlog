This is one of the cooler bits we've run on 10 so far;

> [CalCars... Taking a Prius Hybrid to 100+ MPG!](http://on10.net/TheShow/2892/)

> ...talks to the founder of [CalCars](http://www.calcars.org) and learns how they can convert a Toyota Prius so that it can be charged using your household electricity ... power that is a whole lot cheaper than the gas a normal Prius uses to generate all of its electric power. Learn how they make this work, and how much easier it would be for Toyota to make their hybrids work this way in the first place...

Check it out and join the discussion around hybrid vehicles vs. hydrogen, etc...
