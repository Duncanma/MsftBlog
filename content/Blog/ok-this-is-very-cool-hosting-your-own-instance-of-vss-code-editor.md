First things first.... this should have been two blog entries... because it is way too long for one, and because the two topics are not related... so here I end up, interested only in the hosting of code editors, and I have to link to that other stuff as well... but I digress... ðŸ™‚

The gist of the post (at the least second half that I'm interested in) is that I can host a copy of the code editing window from VS inside a tool window when I'm making my own add-in or other customization within VS... but my question is, and I haven't had time to check this out, would this allow me to host the same code editing window within an external Windows Forms application that isn't in any way hosted in or linked to VS?

I wonder...
