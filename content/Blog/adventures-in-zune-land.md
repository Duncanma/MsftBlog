Visited the Zune buildings today to film an interview for [on10.net](http://on10.net/)... I'd show you a few screen captures from the tape, but I had nothing to do with the camera work so I don't have anything to grab from yet. Since I'm a bit of an Zune enthusiast, Laura and Jesse ran camera and I handled asking the questions of Matt Jubelirer, the Zune team member who was there to show me the device (three devices, he had one of each color with him!) and walkthrough some of the features. I'd expect to see the video up on 10 in the next day or so!
