title: Lacing your running shoes... via animated gifs
type: posts

When my brother took me to buy running shoes a few years ago, he made a point of showing me a couple of ways to lace them up based on the fit I needed... but over time I forgot, and now I have new shoes... luckily for me, the web saves the day (like usual) and I found this on the new balance site: [Lacing for Better Fit](http://www.newbalance.com/productbrowser/performance/lacing_for_a_better_fit.html?sport=Running&gender=&product_type=&feature=)
