title: C# Team Blogs as OPML
type: posts
---
[Gus Perez](http://blogs.msdn.com/gusperez/) has been maintaining [an up-to-date list of C# team blogs](http://blogs.msdn.com/gusperez/archive/2004/03/07/85698.aspx), but after carefully duplicating his categorization in [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.net), I thought I would try putting it up as an OPML file...

You can grab it from [here](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/csharpteam.xml), and import it into your RSS Aggregator of choice... enjoy

_(oh, and I ran into the oddest behaviour when posting this... putting the file up as .opml was causing IE to crash when I tried to view it, Front Page was refusing to edit it and **I have no idea why**. While, I enjoy questing after the truth as much as the next geek, after a few minutes of this I just gave up and made it a .xml file, which worked perfectly in all respects)
