title: Replaced the Poll Component with my 'new and improved' one...

Well, maybe not improved, but certainly more complicated... I setup [my new data model](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/archive/2004/06/15/156543.aspx), built a new voting component in Visual Basic, and put it up at <http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/>

Eventually, once I've run it for awhile and worked out any kinks, this will turn into a published sample...
