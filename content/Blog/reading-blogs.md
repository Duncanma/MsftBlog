I've been catching up on a few blogs, now that I've **finally** managed to get connected ðŸ™‚ ...

and I just have one comment (meant in the spirit of helpfulness only) ... It is "ClickOnce" not "OneClick"

Anyway, check out [my article on ClickOnce](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwinforms/html/clickonce.asp) if you are interested, but watch the name or people might think you are talking about ordering books online...
