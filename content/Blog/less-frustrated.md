title: Less frustrated...
type: posts

I love the internet for one main reason.... [porn](http://www.suicidegirls.com/). Or is the fact that everyone is willing to help you when you have a problem?

Oh yeah, it is that second one.

I [posted recently about my frustrating experiences](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/11/08/870.aspx) with trying to create a CSS based site layout for [my site](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/), and a bunch of people chimed in to help me out. Well, with their help, and after reading some of the [articles](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins) on A List Apart, I was able to get a very basic layout working in both IE and Firefox... although it doesn't currently work in Opera, which surprised me a bit...

Anyway, thanks to everyone for all the help!
