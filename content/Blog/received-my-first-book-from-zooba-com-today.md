If you sign up for one of the sites created by Gratis ([free flat screens](http://www.FreeFlatScreens.com/?r=13882371), [free ipods](http://www.freeiPods.com/?r=14756414), [free handbags](http://www.FreeHandbags.com/?r=14980492), etc...) then one of the available offers is Zooba.com, and I have to say it is one of the best offers I've tried. Basically, if you are someone who likes to read then you probably won't mind the 'requirement' to complete this offer. You sign up for a membership with Zooba, which costs around $10 a month and for that fee you get one hardcover book each month with no shipping costs. I'm not positive, but it seems to me that $10 is a good price for a hardcover book, and not even all that bad if you are used to paperbacks. I filled my queue on their site with 5 books that I liked, but my understanding is that you can cancel after only two book purchases, so the only real question is whether or not there are at least 2 books available through their site that you want to get anyway...

The book I received, by the way, was **The Last Light of the Sun** by one of my favorite authors: [Guy Gavriel Kay](http://www.brightweavings.com/). If you haven't read any of his other books, I would definitely recommend **Tigana**, **The Fionavar Tapestry** (3 books) and all the rest of his writings ðŸ™‚
