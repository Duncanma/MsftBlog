title: Trying out something 'bad'...
type: posts

So, if you missed it... I was just playing with displaying a poll in the blog... don't worry, I won't make a habit of this :)... I did it using <strike>the spawn of evil</strike> an iframe... I've removed it now, the experiment is done... but it exposed an interesting problem. When viewed through the IFRAME IE's default settings (well, my settings... I'm not sure if they are the default) blocked any cookies from that page, which meant that you could vote as often as you liked... hmm... not a good thing. Obviously a second-line of defense is necessary.
