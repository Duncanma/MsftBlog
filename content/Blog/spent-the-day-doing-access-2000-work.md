title: Spent the day doing Access 2000 work...
type: posts
---
As part of the United Way's Day of Caring, I went into Seattle today and did some work for a non-profit counseling center... specifically creating an Access system for them.... a few tables, 3 forms, and a bunch of analysis queries and reports all around stats...

Great stuff.... helping out a non-profit, but it was my first time building anything in Access in ages.... I used to do it all the time as part of past jobs, etc.... but even doing VBA is enough of change for me that I felt really rusty. Overall though, I got the work done and that is the key to a database tool like Access. Personally, while I was longing for SQL Server and VB.NET, I saw a lot of features in Access (even Access 2000) that you just can't find in VB.NET (or C#)...

What do you think? Are there development features of Access that would be good to have in your 'professional' development tools? Use the [comments/feedback](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/09/18/658.aspx#FeedBack) link to let me know your thoughts!
