title: Walking in the 3-Day and interested in promoting your donation page?
type: posts
---
[My wife is going to be in the 3-Day walk for Breast Cancer](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/laura-is-going-to-do-the-breast-cancer-3-day-walk/) and I thought it might be useful to build a widget to display your donation info on a website. So if you are going to walk in the event, or if you know someone who is, then you might be interested in this.



To get this

<img height="211" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/677c05e4-51cc-466b-b0d3-146a2b876c3f.jpg" width="268" />

Just add this text to your page:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/ThreeDay.ashx?donationurl=http://www.the3day.org/Seattle07/lauramackenzie"></script>`

(replace the donation url with the link for the appropriate person... or leave it as Laura's ðŸ™‚ )



Note that I haven't tested this with anyone else's page, so please let me know how it works for you.
