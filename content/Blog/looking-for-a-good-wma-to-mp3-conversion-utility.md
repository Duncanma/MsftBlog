title: Looking for a good WMA to MP3 conversion utility
type: posts

  * for use on non-DRM'd files (one that can do both is fine... it just isn't what I'm going to use it for)
  * must transfer meta data correctly (ID3 tags)
  * batch would be great, point it at a folder structure and let it run

I've tried a couple, but so far I haven't found a single free one that works well... I'd be willing to buy something but I think I really would like a recommendation in that case... there are too many out there and I'm not having any luck finding the 'best' one.

Let me know if anyone has any ideas! Thanks!!
