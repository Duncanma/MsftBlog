title: Amazon Web Services talk in Winnipeg
type: posts
---
I love Winnipeg, but it doesn't normally get all that many developer focused talks... so if you live there and you are interested in .NET based web development, you should really get down to this event.

> [Winnipeg .NET User Group](http://www.dotnetwired.com/)

> Winnipeg, Canada
> October 5, 2006 "Bleeding Edge Web Services"
> Come hear AWS evangelist Mike Culver showcase some thought-provoking new directions into which Web Services are headed. The presentation will provide an overview of Amazon Web Services, and feature a code demonstration showing how .NET developers are able to easily build managed clients for these services.
