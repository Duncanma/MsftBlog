Probably not the best plan in the world, but we sent Laura out with Pizza and a Premium Xbox 360 to try and win the hearts and minds of a line up of PS3 buyers at Target... [watch the video on 10](http://on10.net/Blogs/laura/ps3-is-launching-and-lines-are-forming-well-this-i-just-have-to-see/) (download only right now)... and maybe we'll do the same for the Wii?
