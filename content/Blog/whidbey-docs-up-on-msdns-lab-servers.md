Check out [this link](http://whidbey.msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dv_vbcn/html/d7e97396-7f42-4873-a81c-4ebcc4b6ca02.asp) to go right to the VB section... lots of great info in there... or check out [the C# section here](http://whidbey.msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dv_cscon/html/9bc638b4-757d-43e6-b87b-65a3fa6b787b.asp).

_Note that this **is not** a prototype of the next version of MSDN... it is intended to be consumed by the internal browser in Visual Studio... so the non-IE issues mentioned in the comments and the lack of index/search/etc... are really non-issues considering how this material is intended to be used. I post it only to give a little bit more Whidbey information to folks who haven't installed the Community previews.... using it through a normal browser may not provide the greatest experience at this point ðŸ™‚_
