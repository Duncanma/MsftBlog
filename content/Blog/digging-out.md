title: Digging out...
type: posts
---
It seems like I just got back from the PDC... I opened my laptop for the first time today, which isn't to say I wasn't working... I have email and access to update the various sites I'm working on from other machines... but I certainly wasn't coding. Anyway, the # of unread posts in SharpReader is just ridiculous, probably going to be the incentive to clean out my subscription list...

I thought I should remind folks that a variety of Visual Basic Whidbey information has been posted up at <http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/whidbey> in case that URL never made it around during the madness of information overload that was the PDC.

Speaking of the PDC, I'll be switching [PDC Central](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/) over to a 'static' state today, so it will still have all of [the session materials](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/agendaandsessions/sessions) and all of the ["after the PDC" info](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/after/), but it will direct you to other place for information on the key PDC topics of [Whidbey](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx), [Yukon](http://msdn.microsoft.com/sql) and [Longhorn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn).
