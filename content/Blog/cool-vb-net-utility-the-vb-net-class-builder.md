Sure... I think the Whidbey Class Designer rocks. But you don't have Whidbey today, so you might be interested in a class building utility like this one from Mod2Software.

Check it out [here](http://www.mod2software.com/ProductPages/cbu.htm)

> "This program allows you to build, maintain, and deploy Visual Basic .NET classes quickly and easily, with no fuss. Simply point and click to add class items, tweak their settings, and deploy your class to your project – it&rsquo;s as simple as that! Now you don&rsquo;t have to waste your valuable time writing things like redundant Property Get-Set blocks, the VB.NET Class Builder Utility does that all for you – freeing you up to work on what&rsquo;s important – your code!"
