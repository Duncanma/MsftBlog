title: The C# team is going to be coming after me...
type: posts

Every week, [Eric Gunnerson](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu), [Dan Fernandez](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/) and I get together to work on [the C# developer center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp) and other C#-ish topics... and last week we divided up some tasks amongst the three of us. Well, we are meeting again today and I don't have those tasks done... so I'm starting to watch my back.

I'm expecting Andy (above) to show up in my office at any moment with the C# 'club of motivation', but perhaps I can save myself before he arrives... with your help.

My task was to come up with a good set of questions that we could ask all of our MVPs as part of a "meet the MVPs" section of the developer center. Here's some of the questions I have so far;

  * How did you get into programming/computers?
  * What is your favorite feature or area of C#?
  * What C# or .NET newsgroups or forums do you spend most of your time in?
  * Where would you recommend a C# developer look for answers, code samples, etc...?
  * Do you have any recommendations for books on C#, .NET or related topics?
  * When you aren't answering questions on the web, what do you do as your day job?

These are sounding pretty bland to me so far, so I am hoping you can help me out and supply a few suggestions. What would you like to ask some of these MVPs?

What about someone from the C# or .NET product team? We are also planning to conduct some interviews with them, so let me know what you would want to ask a C# team member and I'll try my best to get your questions onto our list.

Anyway, I'm going to go back under my desk and wait for a friendly visit from a C# team member....
