title: I think it is a good sign that Oblivion makes me anti-social
type: posts

So, another blog post in my series about how much I'm enjoying Oblivion... I really want to buy Blazing Angels, but it seems pointless to get it right now... I know I won't play it. At this point, I probably haven't play anywhere nearly as much as a more dedicated (some one with no children, and without a job that tends to lead to working in the evening?) gamer. But I'm still having a great time. I have just one character at this point (I'll probably go back and start again eventually), a level 8 dark-elf archer who spends way too much time using his sword instead of his bow.

Oblivion thought of the day: Man **Savage Trolls** are annoying!
