title: Ok, if you are programming against AD... this is so very cool...

This very recent article from [CodeProject.com](http://www.codeproject.com/) shows a Windows Forms control (C#) that allows you to browse AD objects... I have some issues with the implemenation (mainly: why use a User Control... why not just inherit from TreeView?), but the idea is great and well... **it works**, so why not take a look!?!
