Hey folks, I've been working with the C# Team and two great C# MVPs (Jon Skeet and Nicholas Paldino) to put together a 'live' C# FAQ. This FAQ is being run as a blog, hosted at [http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq](http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq) and is displayed on the C# Developer Center on MSDN (at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/faq](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/team/faq)).

This list of questions and answers is continually being updated, so if you don't see an answer to your question, and you think it is a common one... please submit it through the ["Ask a FAQ Question"](http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq/archive/2004/03/06/85249.aspx) area of the blog.
