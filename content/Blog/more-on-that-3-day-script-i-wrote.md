title: More on that 3-Day script I wrote...

Darn script removing code on AOL! One woman, Nicolle, has [a blog with AOL](http://journals.aol.com/knowwriter/AmazingAdventures), but it won't let her add script to any part of the UI... or even into a post.

The only way I could think of to try to work out a way around the problem was to make myself an AOL screen name and then an AOL blog and try to do the customizing myself... no go, they don't strip all script tags, but they only allow script tags that are pointing back at certain sites (such as AOL, I'm assuming).

Any way, it was no go for Nicolle... but here is [her donation info](http://www.the3day.org/Arizona07/nicollehoward) for the walk in Arizona... that will be a hot three days!!
