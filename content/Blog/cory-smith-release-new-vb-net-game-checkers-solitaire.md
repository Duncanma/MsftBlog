There is even an accompanying [article](http://addressof.com/blog/articles/checkerssolitaire.aspx). Oh, and a challenge:

>The first person that can send me a history file that shows the gameplay getting to 1 piece left (with the default 8x8x2 game), I'll happily announce it to the world (at least the readers of this site). Do you have what it takes? If you think you do; let the challenge begin. Even if you can get it down to less than 4, I'll be happy to mention your name as well.

Good luck!
