title: Elder Scrolls will now be my official addiction... sorry to anyone who is waiting on work from me :)

I picked up my copy of Elder Scrolls last night, turning down the massive 'guide' (shouldn't I be figuring out the quests by myself?), and after putting the kids to bed I fired it up. Hard to make those initial race/class decisions as always but I went with a Dark Elf Archer, under the sign of the Steed... planning to put a lot of time/points into Blade though, as I almost always do with my RPG characters (my AC character was named Kendo, so you can gather that the sword was a key component). So far I have no complaints, except for the fact that I can't stay home and play all week... oh well, there is always tonight!
