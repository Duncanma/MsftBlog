Microsoft is excited to announce new [Azure Bounty Program](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/bounty-microsoft-azure) awards up to \$60,000 to encourage and reward vulnerability research focused on the highest potential impact to customer security. These increased awards are a part of our ongoing investment in partnership with the security research community, and an important part of Microsoftâ€™s holistic approach to defending against security threats.

**Scenarios and Bounty Awards**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The Azure Bounty Program now includes 6 scenario-based awards for vulnerabilities that could put customer privacy and security at risk of exploitation. Eligible submissions may qualify for 20% and 50% bonuses on top of the current awards. The High Impact Scenarios will continue to evolve as we identify new areas for focused research and higher awards. To learn more about eligible scope and award amounts, please visit the [Azure Bounty Program page](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/bounty-microsoft-azure).
