- Submitted and assessed by the MSRC team between January 1, 2021 and March 31, 2021
- Submitted between October 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 ([last program period](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/01/14/top-msrc-2020-q4-security-researchers--congratulations/)), but assessed after January 1, 2021
