The [MSRC Researcher Recognition Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program) offers public thanks and acknowledgement to the researchers who help protect customers through discovering and sharing security vulnerabilities under [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd). Today, we are excited to recognize this year‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers (MVRs) based on the impact, accuracy, and volume of their reports.

This list recognizes researchers who submitted valid vulnerabilities between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 and met the criteria to become a MSRC 2021 Most Valuable Researcher. To learn more about our program scope and paths to becoming a MSRC 2021 MVR, check out our [blog post](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/02/10/msrc-security-researcher-recognition-2021/). In addition to MVR status, researchers are awarded badges to represent the following achievements:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->

![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-08-accuracy.png) Accuracy - recognizes researchers with 100% accuracy, meaning all of their submissions were valid vulnerability reports

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->

![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-08-impact-1.png) Impact - recognizes high impact work, with the average points per valid vulnerability report at or above the 90th percentile (60 points)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->

![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-08-volume.png) Volume - recognizes a larger body of work, requiring at least five valid vulnerability reports

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->

![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-08-star.png) We originally had an All-Star category, but based on researcher feedback we recognized that it dis-incentivized researchers from sharing their findings across multiple products and services, so we have canceled the All-Star category for this program period.

Congratulations, and we thank each and every one of the researchers that have worked with us over the past year to help secure our customers. We can‚Äôt wait to see what you do next year! Stay tuned for updates to our Researcher Recognition Program in the coming months.
