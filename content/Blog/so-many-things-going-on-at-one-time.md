It has been one of those days... so much content being worked on, almost none of it visible on MSDN yet... but it is coming!

If you were watching closely (and I didn't expect you to be), you'll have noticed some subtle changes on the Dev Centers... my pic went up onto [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic), I created a new books page at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/books](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/books) and there are quite a few changes coming for the C# Developer Center as well...
