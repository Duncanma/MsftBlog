Wow, I'm new to the team and I guess I've missed some of the C9 content over the past few years.... and, as the video description says "the second time we've had Bill on C9" so maybe this isn't as unusual as I think.... but this still really surprised me. I didn't expect to see an inteview with **the man himself** on there. Bill Gates sat down with Charles Torre and chatted about Mix06, Office and more...
