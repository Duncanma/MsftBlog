title: Free sites update...
type: posts

I mentioned earlier how the [Free Xbox 360 site](http://xbox360s.freepay.com/?r=23139488) was quite busy, and it is... tons of clicks, 12 sign-ups, and even one person has 'gone green' which is to say they completed their offer. Once 8 people (who click through your referral link) have signed-up and completed an offer, then you are all done, but the sign-up to completion ratio is not great, probably 1 in every 5, so a lot of folks sign-up and then find that they either are not interested in the available offers or they don't think it is likely that they'll get an additional 8 people to sign-up through them. One of the more difficult aspects of these sites is that they don't tell you how many referrals are needed until **after** you sign up, so if you were thinking 4 referrals and it ends up being 10, that is a pretty good reason to bail on the entire system. I'm currently sitting 3 away on the [PVP](http://www.pvps4free.com/default.aspx?r=160508) site, 4 on the [PSP](http://www.psps4free.com/default.aspx?r=315551) and 4 on the [MP3 Players site](http://www.mp3players4free.com/default.aspx?r=206786)... and, in all honestly, I don't really expect any of them to go completely through. Now that I'm not going through a service like RefStop, where you trade referalls on somone else's account for them signing up through you and doing a referall on your account, 3 or 4 sign-ups is a pretty unlikely target.
