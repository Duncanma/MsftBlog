title: Why C# indeed

Early and Adopter seem to have just noticed my blog;

        [Duncan Mackenzie's](http://dotnetweblogs.com/duncanma/) blogging, and no one told me!



        (And why on earth does [he](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun01242003.asp) have C# code on his blog???)

and they raised a good question, why would I (I'm MSDN's "Content Strategist" for VB, and an affirmed VB Lover) have C# code on my blog?

It isn't by choice, that is for sure! It is his fault: <img alt="Matt [Mr. Web Services] Powell" hspace="0" src="http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/graphics/service.gif" align="baseline" border="0" />

I'm doing a little bit of work on some internal utilities at MSDN and while some of them are in VB.NET, this particular one was written by that crazy [Matt Powell ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/service.asp)fellow and it is all in C#. I've actually managed to break a few things out into their own assemblies and do them in VB.NET, but for the most part the UI is all in C#... what is a guy to do? I'll try to avoid starting a religous debate here, but I have to at least say that the C# editor sucks compared to the VB.NET one... XML commenting aside! I've heard it is much closer in features to VB.NET in VS.NET 2003, but I haven't done anything but VB.NET in that version of VS.NET, so I don't really know...

Sadly, after only a few days of working on this system, I started adding semicolons to my VB.NET code... Is that like calling your wife by the wrong name?
