title: Grant discusses Iterators...
type: posts
---
I've often had email exchanges and thought about posting them as blog entries... and now I've seen someone do it... and I have to say that it is a little hard to read (for the email part, start at the bottom and read up... which is normal for email, but not intuitive in a blog posting)... That difficulty is worth going through though because if you read the entire post you'll find out lots of useful info... ðŸ™‚

    [More thoughts on Iterators](http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/archive/2004/05/07/127714.aspx)  _... This got me thinking some more about iterators.  The frameworks often use an int as a version field to detect when a collection has changed.  This seems like a bit of overkill and isn't 100% correct because it does suffer from wrap-around (although that is almost entirely impossible short of malicious code).  So I was wondering how you could write 100% correct code and still use an iterator, and have it be clean and maintainable code...._
