So I've been wanting to go to [PAX](http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com) since it started a couple of years ago, and every time it has come around I've been out of town... until now... and, by some interesting twist of fate, I know [have a job that actually required me to attend](http://www.on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/5132/) ðŸ™‚

So [Tina](http://www.tinawood.net/), Sampy, [Adam](http://adamkinney.com) and I headed over there today, snuck in ahead of the massive line with our snazzy media badges and started filming... some highlights

  * Serving "BAWLS" everywhere leads to [many great quotes](http://www.kinetixgaming.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=429dd3fafa968a71f390a8670b5e075a&topic=406.0), especially funny if you are 9 years old, but we laughed anyway
  * Console Tourney... competive Smash Bros, how much cooler can it get?

  * Case Mods in the Bring Your Own Computer room, I'm already voting for the [FF 2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Penny_Arcade_characters#Minor_Characters) case to win hands down. It was so cool that both Sampy and myself interviewed them (that is what happens when we split up and give two devs each a camera... silly us).

Note that this is an "in progress" pic, not the final case mod... I'll post that soon... check out [this photo set for the whole mod in pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/theadam/tags/fruitfucker).

  * Alex St. John... wow... cigars... stories... and brave enough to bring his daughters to an event with many thousand gamers (the # of black shirts on the streets of Bellevue was unbelievable).
