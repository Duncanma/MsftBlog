Adam Kinney, another member of our three-person dev team, [posts our favorite comments](http://www.adamkinney.com/note.aspx?id=112) about [the preview site ](http://on10.net)so far. Scoble, who really is on the same team as me... despite the fact that I've hardly ever seen him :)... also [discusses what we have been up to](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/03/07/what-my-coworkers-have-been-doing/#respond).
