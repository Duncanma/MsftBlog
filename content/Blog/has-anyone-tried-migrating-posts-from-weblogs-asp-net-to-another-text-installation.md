title: Has anyone tried migrating posts from weblogs.asp.net to another .Text installation?
type: posts

I've set up my own little .Text installation and I'm considering copying (not removing the existing versions) posts to my installation so that I still have a visible archive... has anyone done this before? 

Happen to have created a tool or script to help the process?
