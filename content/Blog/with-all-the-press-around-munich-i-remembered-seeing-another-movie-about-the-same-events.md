title: With all the press around 'Munich', I remembered seeing another movie about the same events...

Turns out it was a TV movie ([Sword of Gideon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002IQIH4/duncanmackenz-20?creative=327641&#038;camp=14573&#038;link_code=as1)), but still... I'm surprised that it isn't mentioned in any of the [reviews/articles about 'Munich'](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/munich/) that I've read so far.... ([IMDB info](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092038/)). Any one else seen the TV movie?
