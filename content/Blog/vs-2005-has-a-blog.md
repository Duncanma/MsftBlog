If you are using the CTP (Community Technical Preview) or you are just interested in Whidbey/VS2005, then you'll definitely want to check out the new blog created to allow various team members to post info on VS2005. Check it out [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/vs2005news/).

You might also be interested in [the relatively new VS2005 portal on MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/).
