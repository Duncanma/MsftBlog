A [recent post](http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001272.php) by Wil Wheaton manages to show his flair for descriptive writing, his complete geekness (surrender to it folks, it is the only way), and the joy a father feels when he is admired by his step son. And it does all of this while including tea in the narrative; what more could you want?
