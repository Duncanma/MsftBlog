> Just yesterday I spotted an old dusty lamp and begun to clean it.
>
> With my greatest surprise a geni[e] popped out offering to fullfill a wish. Being a train lover and wishing to visit the USA I asked for a rail bridge across the Atlantic Ocean.
>
> The geni[e] got sad and said [to]me: "Sorry but did you consider the amount of material needed for the bridge, the tectonic shift not counting the
> fact that one should get Europeans to agree on a common electric power supply and on the environmental impact, please ask me something
> different..."
>
> So I thought for a while and asked "I want a ps3 in europe this xmas" and then the geni[e] asked "Single or double track bridge sir ?"
