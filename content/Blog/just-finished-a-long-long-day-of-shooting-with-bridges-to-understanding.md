This group, [http://www.bridgesweb.org](http://www.bridgesweb.org), is an amazing example of what I think [http://on10.net](http://on10.net/about.aspx) is all about. Phil Borges and the other folks involved with this non-profit devote an enormous amount of time to travelling the world and helping kids tell their stories using the new technologies available today. Here is a shot I took today of one of the workshop participants (Mel) helping one of the kids (Stefano?) take some great shots of a steam engine... and yes, I suck at remembering names!
