title: Using what you write
type: posts
---
The [Coding4Fun](http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/codefun.asp) column has had some interesting side effects. I get to use the code I write, something that isn't very common when you are paid to write samples.

I wanted to pull down [the new Matrix Trailer](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/sequel_trailers.html), but it is around 60mb and I often switch networks ([VPN on/off to get my mail](http://dotnetweblogs.com/ksharkey/posts/5206.aspx), connect to the VSS on an internal server, etc.) so I opened the Background Copy program from my [second issue](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02282003.asp)... off it goes, incremental background download (can't take credit for any of that, thank the team that built [BITS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/bits/bits/using_bits.asp)!).. my wife has had the email checker (actually an early build without an options dialog, I just put the values right into the .config file for her) from [the third issue ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun03282003.asp)running 24/7 and [my home music system ](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp)uses the code techniques from [the first issue ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun01242003.asp)as it scans our system for music updates every few hours.

This is pretty cool so far, and right now I'm running some code, (that I hope will make it in as part of the next issue/installment), that is making my Messenger name into something ugly like "Duncan (Listening To: I Love Myself Today â€“ Bif Naked [3:52])"

The next thing is to make it work the other way around: instead of personally using code I wrote for publication, I want to publish [code I wrote at home ](http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=cd71ce33-9238-4ba0-a1e6-294413f743b9)for use by everyone else.
