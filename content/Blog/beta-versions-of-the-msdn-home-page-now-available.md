title: Beta versions of the MSDN home page now available...
type: posts
---
I've been working (as part of a large team!) on the new platform for MSDN, which is up and running at [http://msdn2.microsoft.com](http://msdn2.microsoft.com)... and now you can see prototype versions of the MSDN home page ontop of that same platform. Check it out here [[http://beta.msdn.microsoft.com/default.aspx](http://beta.msdn.microsoft.com/default.aspx)]. The new home page demonstrates some of the personalization/profile features that will end up on the final MSDN site in the near future.
