This is so very cool... I wonder if they need any programmers? Of course, my wife wouldn't like it if it meant lots of travel!

> When you think of natural disaster, software programs rarely come to mind. But Ted Okada and Robert Kirkpatrick of Microsoft’s Humanitarian Systems know from experience that where there’s a crisis, software can be a life-saver. On the front lines of war, earthquakes and floods Ted and Robert develop software applications that aid rescue efforts, assist medical workers, expedites counting and locating displaced people and helps disperse badly needed resources.
> We’ll meet Ted Okada and discuss the work of the Humanitarian Systems Initiative and he’ll demonstrate how he’s builds an application and how it helps in the recovery of a disaster struck area.
