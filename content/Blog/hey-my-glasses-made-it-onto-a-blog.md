Kent has been posting pics and my glasses made it into [the shot](http://weblogs.asp.net/ksharkey/posts/26944.aspx)! Wow, this is pretty exciting, I think I'll go lie down.

Here's another pic from that day... just to keep up with the trend;

_note the lack of glasses... generally a sign of a bad day,
it means I was busy holding my head in my hands or rubbing my eyes ðŸ™‚_
