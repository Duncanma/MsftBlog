title: Managed code samples from the Exchange SDK
type: posts

From [KC Lemson's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/kclemson)...

> **[ASP.Net samples of WebDAV against Exchange 2003](http://blogs.msdn.com/kclemson/archive/2004/01/23/62247.aspx)**

> In a previous entry, I received a comment about how there were no examples of using WebDAV in the Exchange SDK with ASP.Net... I forwarded it to our SDK team (who can be reached at exsdkfb AT microsoft DOT com) and they pointed out several examples for me:
>
>   * Searching Folders (WebDAV) – C# and VB.Net
>   * Sending a Message (WebDAV) – C# and VB.Net
>   * Getting the Size of a Mailbox (WebDAV) – C# and VB.Net
>   * The Notifications Sample Application – C#
>
> If you would like to request any more managed code samples in the SDK, drop them a line at [the email address above](http://blogs.msdn.com/kclemson/contact.aspx), or add a comment to this entry and I will forward it on.
