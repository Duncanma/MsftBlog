Free chapter on master pages from new ASP.NET 2.0 upgrade guide

Murach Books is offering a free chapter from their new book, Murach's ASP.NET 2.0 Upgrader's Guide: VB Edition, at their web site at [www.murach.com/books/ugvb/index.htm](http://www.murach.com/books/ugvb/index.htm). Chapter 3, "How to use master pages," shows how to use the new ASP.NET 2.0 master pages feature to easily include banners, navigation menus, and other elements on all of the pages in a web application. It's a powerful, time-saving feature that most developers will want to use in every new application they create.
