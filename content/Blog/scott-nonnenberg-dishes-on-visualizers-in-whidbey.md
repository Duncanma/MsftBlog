title: Scott Nonnenberg dishes on Visualizers in Whidbey
type: posts
---
[Scott](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottno/) goes into detail on the cool "Visualizers" feature of the Whidbey debugger in his post "[visualizers for PDC Whidbey](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottno/archive/2004/02/20/77249.aspx)";

> _Visualizers are custom viewers meant to be used at debug-time. They are entirely managed, and associated with particular types. Where before DataSet was a horrible mess in the watch window, now the standard DataGrid can be used to view the previously inaccessible data contained therein._
