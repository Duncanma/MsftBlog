title: Ugh.. I want to code...
type: posts
---
I have a bunch of writing to do, but what I really want to do is code!

It turns out I have a bunch of coding to do as well... but the writing is _more overdue_ than the coding (at the moment)!

Of course, I could just say to hell with them both and go play some [SW:KOTOR](http://www.lucasarts.com/products/swkotor), but I finished it a couple of nights ago and I'm not quite ready to start again... although the dark path should provide some interesting replay value.

I recently finished the first chapter of a new book quite a bit ahead of schedule. The book isn't due out for quite awhile, but I was offered a place on the PDC version of the Whidbey DVD(s) _if I could get it in by last week_, and that was a chance I didn't want to miss. Not going to the PDC? Well, don't worry... I'm sure it will be posted somewhere pretty quick after the event... and it might even end up on [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic) around the same time.... hmm... I think I'm stalling, I'd better get back to work.
