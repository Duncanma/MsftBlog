Ok, if you are a programmer... or even if you just can relate enough that you think Office Space is one of the best movies in the world (doesn't everyone?) then I need you to do this:

  * Go to [http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songs](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songs)
  * Scroll down to "Thing a Week III"
  * Click on the play button next to Code Monkey

Enjoy!

[Jonathan](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/) works on the [Popular Science podcast](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=154114341), does music for John Hodgman's [Little Gray Books](http://www.littlegraybooks.com/), and used to be a programmer (although I don't think you ever stop being a programmer, you just decide to do something else with most of your time)

Oh, and since I went there today... here is another selection from Jonathan's site: [Ikea.mp3](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/mp3/Ikea.mp3)

And thanks to my great-grand-boss [Steve](http://blogs.msdn.com/scellini/) (link is to his blog... last entry back in September of 2005... just so you know **before** you click on it and get all disappointed) for sending me this song tonight!
