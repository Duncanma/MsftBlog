title: Ever send yourself an email and then click on the 'you have new mail' alert a moment later?
type: posts

I send myself email... which sounds more pathetic than it is. I just use it as a way to hang onto links or notes to myself (do this, watch [this](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20060831MobileRB/manifest.xml), etc...). I do it all the time. Every once in awhile though, right after I send something to myself I see the 'new mail' pop up on my computer and I click on it wondering 'hey, what's that...'. And then I feel silly.
