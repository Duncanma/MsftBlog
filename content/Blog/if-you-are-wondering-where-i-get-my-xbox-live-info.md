title: If you are wondering where I get my Xbox Live info...
type: posts
---
A few people have emailed me or posted comments wondering how I grab the Xbox Info for [the Twitter app](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/connect-your-xbox-360-gamertag-to-twitter/) and for [my services](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/put-up-a-rest-api-for-xbox-gamertag-data/).

It is not from scraping and it is not from any publicly available source. I joined the Xbox Community Developer Program (XCDP), which is an official program designed to support folks who are building [community sites](http://www.xboxusersgroup.com/index.php) (forums, reviews, blogs, etc...) around Xbox related topics.

Many folks who want Xbox info, are not working on [a large site](http://www.mygamercard.net/) like the people in the XCDP, which is exactly why I created my service. This way, people who are building a small tool or script, most likely to be used by a small number of folks, can have access to some well formed and easy to use data.

What if you would qualify for the XCDP? Well, at the moment I don't have any direct link for you, but I'll ask around to see if I can find a link or a contact for anyone may qualify and would like to sign up....
