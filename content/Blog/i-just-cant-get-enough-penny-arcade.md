He was talking about the generic bad guys in the new Prince of Persia game, but this line crosses into Halo, and it is so true...

In Halo the grunts have a lot of great lines, the general gist of which is that they are pretty terrified of you... and they run away a lot... so, while you kinda have to get them (even little creatures can hold weapons), it just seems wrong.
