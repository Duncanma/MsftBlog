title: Conga Lines....
type: posts

A few people have emailed to let me know about the various 'conga lines' out there, for people interested in the referral based offers [discussed in my previous post](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/01/12/985.aspx). One source for these, that I know of, is [a forum on GearLive](http://www.gearlive.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=18&#038;sid=4860d5ca207ebcace9dc8ba2d8cbbb59) that lists a few different ones.

I guess it isn't surprising that these things exist, someone created a difficult to follow process, so trust the gadget geeks to quickly try to 'automate' it ðŸ™‚
