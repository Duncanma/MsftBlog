title: COM Port Programming in .NET
type: posts

Just noticed a post by Chris Johnson, [http://weblogs.asp.net/cjohnson/posts/27887.aspx](http://weblogs.asp.net/cjohnson/posts/27887.aspx) about serial port programming in .NET, he detailed the general lack of options, but I thought I should chime in.... If you get the [Visual Basic Resource Kit,](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit) it includes a free control from Sax that provides an easy way to do serial port work using .NET...
