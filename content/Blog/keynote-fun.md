Well, those demos have certainly floored me... but I must say I'm torn.

As a Microsoft guy, I'm pretty pumped about all of the new stuff... but as a developer, I have to admit a feeling of sadness seeing all of this cool code (mostly the Avalon and WinFS stuff for me) that I won't be able to write into a production app for quite some time.

Duncan's big takeaway? I need to bump up the CPU, GPU and memory on [my music machine](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp) so that, at least at home, I can run Longhorn on it and write all of the UI using Avalon!
