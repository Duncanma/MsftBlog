title: Playing around with pulling my articles into my own site's chrome...
type: posts

Check out my [articles page](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/articles), which is built from [an RSS file](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/articles/rss.xml) by the way, and click on any of the "Coding 4 Fun" articles. You'll end up still in my site, but viewing the full MSDN article. Mostly I'm just playing around, but it seemed 'neat' enough to mention ðŸ™‚

By the way, the jury is still out on whether or not I've opened myself to various new security risks through this code, so if you want to try and hack my site using this new "pull" concept, go for it... I'd really appreciate it if you'd let me know if you find anything though, in the interest of science that is ðŸ™‚
