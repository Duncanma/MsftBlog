Ok, so I have to admit something... when I saw Assassin's Creed in the various [E3 videos](http://www.on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/3052/), I was sad. The game looked amazing, but I'm not going to buy a PS3 ... you can see my dilemma.

Then I see [this on Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2006/07/25/assassins-creed-for-xbox-360-gets-previewed/) ... and considering God of War II is a PS2 title (not that I have a PS2, but I'm thinking about it... more on the later) ...  there isn't anything announced yet for the PS3 that I feel like I'm going to miss.
