> Halo 2 is officially coming to Vista.  It is shipping to retailers on May 22nd.  I sit down with Jo Clowes from Hired Gun to talk about new features, new maps and what we can expect from Halo 2 on Vista. We bring you all the cool visuals.  Jo talks to us about some of the achievements you can earn for both single player and multi-player.  There's a flaming Ninja achievement you earn through multi-player where you kill three....oh, well you'll just have to watch the video to find out about that one.

Including footage of me playing through a few moments of the first level... and even a shot of my gamercard ðŸ™‚
