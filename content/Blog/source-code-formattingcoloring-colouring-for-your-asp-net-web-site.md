title: Source Code formatting/coloring (colouring!) for your ASP.NET web site
type: posts

Kent points us to [a free ASP.NET control](http://www.acmebinary.com/blogs/kent/archive/2006/06/05/603.aspx) that pretties up any source code you output to your site... most systems I've used convert the code into html, but this one lets you leave it in its proper form (for downloading or copying to the user's clipboard) and does the coloring at runtime.
