title: Gregg Miskelly on Debugging Interop Issues
type: posts
---
[Gregg](http://blogs.msdn.com/greggm) discusses "[Why interop debugging is difficult](http://blogs.msdn.com/greggm/archive/2004/01/23/62455.aspx)"...

> _The Visual Studio debugger supports debugging both .NET code and native code at the same time. We call this &lsquo;interop&rsquo;. At first glance, this might not seem like much of an accomplishment. After all, we support debugging .NET code well enough, and we support debugging native code. What&rsquo;s so hard about doing both at the same time?_
