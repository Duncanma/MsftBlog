title: This didn't take long.... putting your Tivo shows onto a PSP...
type: posts

[Brian](http://www.bufferoverrun.net) and I were chatting (arguing actually) about the [PSP](http://www.psps4free.com/default.aspx?r=315551) the other day at lunch... I thought the idea of selling movies for the device, movies that you couldn't use in a DVD player at home, was crazy and Brian didn't. Brian's opinion is likely the more accurate one (it usually is), these PSP movies will probably sell, definitely at airports and for rentals and probably in less volume for _normal_ use...

What we both agreed upon though, was that if there was a way to sync a PSP with your MCE or Tivo (like you can do now with the [Portable Media Center](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/portablemediacenter/default.mspx) devices), then that would be totally cool and would probably be a killer app for a lot of people... [well, here you go](http://homeentertainment.engadget.com/entry/1234000783037778/)... it sounds like it isn't very polished, but I'm sure there will be improvements over time.

This 'hobbyist' application market certainly isn't closed though. I'm sure that applications that move media onto memory sticks in the right formats for the PSP are going to be popular, so if you are into such things you might want to start coding.
