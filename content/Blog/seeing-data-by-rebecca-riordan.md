title: Seeing Data by Rebecca Riordan...

[Shawn](http://weblogs.asp.net/shawnmor/archive/2004/09/06/226224.aspx), my boss, recommends [this AW book by Rebecca Riordan](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321205618/duncanmackenz-20?creative=125581&#038;camp=2321&#038;link_code=as1), which is one of the few .NET books I've found time to read lately, and I have to agree... I have doubts on whether or not it will sell as many copies as it should, as people seem to cluster around very focused books even when **this book is exactly what they need**, but it certainly deserves to be successful.

Most Visual Basic development, both historically and present day, is building Forms that run against databases (that probably describes most development across all languages, but I believe it is an even higher percentage for VB)... and this book aims directly at that topic... covering both Windows Forms and ADO.NET, while teaching you how to **design and build** a good user interface, instead of just focusing on the mechanics of the .NET classes like most books do.
