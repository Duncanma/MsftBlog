Last night I jumped on a flight at around 11pm in Seattle and flew to Boston, getting in around 7am, then I drove up to the offices of Mad Doc software... makers of quite a few cool games, including Empire Earth II, Star Trek Armada II and now Star Trek: Legacy for the Xbox 360 (and for the PC). Interview is all done now and I'm on my way back, with a ton of great footage for the on10.net crowd ðŸ™‚

First impressions? Of all the previous Star Trek games, Armada II was the one I liked the most, and while this is certainly not Armada III, it does share some of the same features... ship to ship combat on a fleet wide scale! Legacy takes it much farther though, better graphics, better AI, better story... co-op play across Xbox Live...
