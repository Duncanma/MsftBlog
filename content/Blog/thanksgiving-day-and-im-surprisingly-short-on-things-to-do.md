title: Thanksgiving day... and I'm surprisingly short on things to do...
type: posts

Lots of plans for the weekend, lights to put up, some yard work... but today, my daughter is napping, my son is keeping himself very busy with a new remote control car that has a built in video camera (he is chasing the kitten around the family room)... I'm not quite 'free' enough to put in Mass Effect and try it out, but that will come later!
