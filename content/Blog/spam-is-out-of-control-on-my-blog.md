title: Spam is out of control on my blog
type: posts

Not that it affects you, the reader, all that much... but I'm getting around 9000 spam comments a day now. It is crazy. I'd add code to avoid them, but I'm just finishing up a move to some new blog software that Adam and I wrote (you can see it running on [Adam's site already](http://www.adamkinney.com/)) and I don't really want to spend any more time in the .Text code base...
