One of my teammates just left the team ... glad [he cleared up some of the rumours as quickly as he did](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/06/10/correcting-the-record-about-microsoft/)... it was a bit sad how quickly people came up with a list of Microsoft-bashing comments. Anyway, I wonder who is getting his new camera ðŸ™‚
