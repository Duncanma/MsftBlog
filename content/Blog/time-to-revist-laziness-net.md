[I created a Pocket PC remote for Windows Media Player](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun06272003.asp), but I only had speakers right next to [the music system](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp)... so the remote wasn't all that useful... but I just picked up this wireless speaker;

and suddenly it is time to install that software again ... my wife now puts the speaker wherever she is during the day, but having to go into my office and login to change the music is a small annoyance, so I hope the visual remote helps make it easier.
