At the end of May, Oprah is coming to Seattle to do an all day workshop... and I really wanted to get my wife (and a friend) tickets. Well, when the day of ordering came I was swamped and it totally slipped my mind until the evening... at which point it was too late. Next stop for the desperate man, eBay... lots of auctions of tickets, but once they reached up into 300 to 400% of face value, I declined to continue... so, no tickets that way. Just last week though an auction started up asking only face value, I bid ... no one else bid... I won! Wait, upon closer inspection; the seller is in the Seattle area... the tickets are for St. Louis, MO... and they are for May 10th not May 31st...



Great. I have $370 worth of Oprah tickets to a show in another state in three days.
