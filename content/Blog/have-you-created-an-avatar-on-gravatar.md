title: Have you created an Avatar on Gravatar?
type: posts
---
Some people have great ideas, like Tom Werner's Gravatar (Globally Recognized Avatar) site... [a single place on the web to upload an avatar](http://www.gravatar.com/about.php) that any blog software can then retrieve using a fairly easily constructed URL. Neat stuff, I think I'll add it to my site.
