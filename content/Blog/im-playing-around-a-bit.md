title: I'm playing around a bit...
type: posts

I've added some functionality to my personal site because I now have SQL Server available on the back end... so, as a test, I've put a voting component onto the home page at [http://www.duncanmackenzie.net](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net) ... I plan to add some features to it (like 'just show me the results, I don't want to vote'), but for now feel free to check it out as it is.

Note that, at the moment, I am just using the component that is in use on [www.asp.net](http://www.asp.net) and is available from the 'control gallery' on that site.
