title: Digital Media and Media Center Topics
type: posts

I'm getting back into [my column](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx) writing, and I'm looking for topic suggestions... I actually have a long list of ideas already, but I'm always interested in hearing what you folks want to read about!

So... suggest away! Feel free to include topics related to the [Media Center edition of Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/) as I'm planning to spend some time with the developer side of that product over the next few months.
