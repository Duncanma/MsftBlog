title: Rory joins the team...
type: posts

If you don't already know Rory, well... keep watching [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/)... I'm sure you'll be hearing more from him through that venue soon.

For now, he has joined us over in the 'dev' hallway, which I'm sure he finds quite exciting... maybe not as exciting as his Microsoft provided 'temp housing', but maybe it is close.

> "My apartment is very nice, but the complex in which it is situated is a tad on the trashy side. I expected to find a just-add-water meth lab in the kitchen of my corporate apartment. It would have provided me a way to fit in and make friends with the neighbors, but alas and alack, such luck was not to be mine. I wasn't even provided a gun." â€“ From [Rory's moving day post](http://neopoleon.com/home/blogs/neo/archive/2006/10/19/22315.aspx)
