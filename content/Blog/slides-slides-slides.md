I updated a ton of sessions on [the PDC site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/agendaandsessions/sessions/default.aspx) today, many (yep, I'm being vague... I don't have the details with me at the moment) sessions that didn't have slides do now.

You may also notice that the location of the PPT files has changed... I moved them all to a different location (the download center of Microsoft.com) and I will eventually be pulling down the old ones (that were on a GotDotNet location), so don't count on any of the earlier direct file URLs to stay valid.  

Oh, and if you had issues with printing or opening some of the decks, it turns out there was some sort of font issue with some of them and these new copies no longer have that problem.
