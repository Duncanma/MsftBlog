title: Yet another experiment.... forums...
type: posts
---
I need authentication and role based security for another project that is _coming soon_, so I've put forums up at [http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/forums/](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/forums/) ... nothing there at the moment, but feel free to visit the 'discussion' forum and contribute your ideas...

  * What forums should I add? I was thinking one per article I write (for ongoing discussion) but what else?
  * There are lots of forums in the world, is there something missing that could exist...
