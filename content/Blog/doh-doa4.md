More reason to [feel bad about not having a Xbox 360](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2006/01/09/3520.aspx) yet... my brother bought me DOA4 for Christmas, for the 360, and it just arrived yesterday. I haven't opened it yet, but I put it up on top of the TV and pretended I was playing it, using the most powerful gaming console of them all... my imagination! ðŸ™‚
