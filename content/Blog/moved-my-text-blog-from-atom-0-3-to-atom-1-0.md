title: Moved my .Text blog from Atom 0.3 to Atom 1.0
type: posts
---
I only recently noticed that my blog software (.Text 0.95) had [atom support](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/atom.aspx) built in, so I added a button to [my main page](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/), and then I noticed it was Atom 0.3. Since 0.3 was [recently deprecated](http://www.feedvalidator.org/news/archives/2005/09/15/atom_03_deprecated.html), I updated the Atom generating code to output 1.0 instead and voila;

[![[Valid Atom 1.0]](/images/valid-atom.png "Validate my Atom 1.0 feed")](http://www.feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/atom.aspx)

Much thanks to rakaz's [great guide on moving from 0.3 to 1.0](http://www.rakaz.nl/nucleus/item/103), which enabled me to update my code with almost no knowledge of Atom 0.3 or 1.0 ðŸ™‚
