As you may have noticed, [I've been playing with Soapbox lately](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/tags/Soapbox/) and it is rocking. Yep, there are other sites out there, but I've been finding the quality (it is all flash video folks, but there is still a range of quality) of the videos I've uploaded to Soapbox to be a few steps above the other sites (or is it just site now that [Google bought YouTube](http://finance.google.com/finance?cid=2974344)?). Laura Foy from on 10 went and [interviewed the Soapbox team](http://www.on10.net/Blogs/laura/soapbox/) and managed to get a special link so that on10.net viewers can sign up for their very own beta account on Soapbox! Watch [the video](http://www.on10.net/Blogs/laura/soapbox/) and then click on the link to get your own account!
