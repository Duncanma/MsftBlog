title: Interesting discussion on GotDotNet around the use of VSS...
type: posts
---
The discussion started with the question of 'what should you put into VSS, other than source code?' and it has grown from there... you can check it out [here](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/Thread.aspx?id=273572)

You may agree or disagree with my statements, but either way... it is a good discussion to have...
