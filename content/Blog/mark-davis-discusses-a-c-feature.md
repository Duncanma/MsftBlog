    <b> <a id="viewpost.ascx_TitleUrl" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/markda/archive/2004/06/16/157685.aspx">Visual C# 2003 "Implement Interface" feature</a> </b> <font face="Verdana">  _Just discovered a great tip for Visual C# 2003._



    <font face="Verdana"> _If you implement an interface (or event/delegate) on your class and don't want to type all the methods, just type the interface name in your class derivation list and Intellisense will display <font color="#000000">a tooltip saying “Press TAB to insert stubs for <interfacename>”. Pressing 'TAB' will insert stub method implemenations into your class. Very cool timesaver!_
