title: Retrieving File Icons for specific file types
type: posts
---
I just uploaded a new sample to microsoft.com, pulling some useful code out of another MSDN sample that was so unrelated that I figured that this little bit of interesting code would never be found. This code sample shows how to retrieve the icon for any given file type and it does it through a pretty cool component that exposes 2 ImageLists to make it easy to use with a ListView or TreeView.

That link might not be live for a little bit while it replicates out to the download servers, but the code is available at;
