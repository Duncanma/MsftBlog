title: Some things shouldn't be an impulse buy
type: posts

As my lack of posts might suggest, I'm completely under water these days at work, but I did find time to take a week long vacation back to Winnipeg, Manitoba. While I was there I snapped this shot of a sign that I've been amused by for a few years now... (click the picture to see the full size version)

[ <img src="http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/ImmediateCremation.jpg" align="left" height="120" width="160" title="Immediate Cremation" border="0" /> ](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/images/ImmediateCremation.jpg" title="Click to view the full picture" rel="lightbox[846]) I guess I would understand this text in a yellow-pages ad, if you know you have to find a place that offers this service you'd be looking in that section of the yellow-pages and this would be useful information, but on a street-side sign doesn't make as much sense to me. I can only imagine someone driving down the road, seeing the sign and thinking... "hmm... that's not a bad price, maybe I should take advantage of that right now on the way home... I **have** been feeling a bit run down lately."
