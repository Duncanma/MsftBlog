[Julia appears to have lost something](http://weblogs.asp.net/jlerman/posts/36951.aspx)

> I downloaded and installed the [VB Language Enhancements for Whidbey](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/whidbey) White Paper & code from an MSI and cannot freakin' find it anywhere! ðŸ™‚ I had to stop looking after 20 minutes. So hopefully, I'll update this post with the location after Duncan or someone can clue me in. I'm not mad. I think it's kind of funny.

Ok, Ok... so I built that install file... so I guess I'm the one to blame. I haven't gotten around to writing a custom action to launch the folder after install, but it is on my list of things-to-do ... unless someone else writes it first! In general though, all of my installs put things under My Documents\MSDN so that you don't require admin privileges to open up the code and modify it... I hope that works out for folks!

If you have any thoughts on improving the install process of any of the installs from MSDN, let me know and I'll try to improve our process where ever possible.
