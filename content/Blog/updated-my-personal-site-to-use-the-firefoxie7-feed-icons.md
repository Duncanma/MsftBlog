title: Updated my personal site to use the Firefox/IE7 feed icons...

As per the blog entry "[Feed icons](http://blogs.msdn.com/justsean/archive/2005/12/30/508181.aspx "Microsoft WebBlogs")" and using icons pulled from the new [feedicons](http://www.feedicons.com) site. Hopefully [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com) will follow suit as well, which would probably be pretty easy... it looks like they are mostly linking every instance of the 'old' RSS icon to the same graphic. I'll suggest it and we'll see what happens.
