description: One of the hardest jobs of a manager is to determine the rewards for your team.

I have been a manager at Microsoft for about 18 years and for quite a bit of it I have been a 'manager of managers', which means I often spend time working with my team on how to properly handle annual rewards. 

> At Microsoft folks often refer to managers as either M1, M2, or M3. I heard these terms for years without actually having any idea what they meant, until I became a M2 and it made sense. M1 is a manager with ICs (Individual Contributors or non-managers) under them, M2 is a manager of managers, and a M3 is a manager of managers. This can continue up I assume, but M3 is where I was for the past few years, although I am now a M2. This could be a common term at other companies, but for me it was a mystery for a bit.


## What are rewards?

Depending on your particular company, employees will be rewarded with some mix of 

 - a raise to their base pay
 - a bonus
 - some type of equity (stock grants or stock options)

This is often an annual event, but it could be more frequent. I could write pages on the difference between those three kinds of rewards and why you would increase/decrease one vs. another, but for the purpose of this article I believe we can just lump them all together as 'rewards'. 

There is a limited amount of money for each year's rewards, so like any budgeting exercise the manager has to decide how to distribute funds across their team. How much money there is in total is, similar to the types of rewards above, not all that relevant to this discussion. We can go super simple here and imagine a situation where we had ten employees and a total rewards budget of one hundred dollars.

We could give every employee the same rewards, ten dollars, or we could give one employee one hundred dollars and the other nine nothing. Assume there are no restrictions. Now, with our problem space defined, we are in the same spot as most managers. How do we determine the rewards for each individual?

## Consider the message

As an employee, you might not have much visibility to this process, you just know that last year you received a certain amount of rewards and now you are about to find out this year's. Looking at it from this point of view is critical. 

**If the amount is lower, you will feel like your manager (or your company) think you did a worse job than last year. If it is higher, they must feel you did a better job.** 

That's it. That is the key to deciding what to give as rewards. You can make this as complicated as you want, trying to quantify their impact and determine exactly what they did (and you should definitely be able to document and explain their greater or lower impact to the team), but in the end you will be sending a message. They will receive that message no matter what other feedback you have delivered over the year. If you tell me I did awesome, but give me lower rewards, then I know you think I didn't actually do as well as last year. If you tell me I had less impact this year and need to improve, but then give me increased rewards, I will be very confused.

As a manager, I suggest you go through your team many times, first assessing their impact (at Microsoft we explicitly like to look at this as a holistic discussion, did they deliver on their work, did they help their peers or other teams, etc.), and the going back and considering the message you are sending. The two should line up. This isn't suggesting that you always make sure you are rewarding someone **more** than last year. Their rewards should be completely determined by the impact they had on the team this year, but if you want to know how these rewards will be received then look to see if it is more, less, or about the same as last year. In my experience, about the same is generally seen as 'less' because people expect to see at least some increase year over year. The degree of difference matters as well, a little bit up or down is sending less of a message than a large increase.

## Peanut-buttering

Most new managers immediately say to me 'but everyone did a great job, can't I just give them all high rewards?'. Given a fixed budget, what this will do is give them all the middle of the possible reward range. I heard this refered to once as 'peanut buttering' and that name has stuck with me for years, spreading the rewards equally across the team. There is a positive to this, treating the team like a real team, that rises and falls together, but **only if the rewards budget is tied to the team's impact**. If more money is available when the team has done great work than when they do just 'good' work, everyone will be rewarded more when the team delivers. 'A rising tide lifts all boats'. If, on the other hand, the amount of rewards available is a fixed budget, then equally distributing the rewards each year just means that everyone gets medium rewards all the time. To go back to the point of this article, what message does that send? Using our earlier example of 100 dollars for 10 team members, if that 100 dollars is fixed and we give out equal rewards that is 10 dollars for everyone. Next year, the team really pulls together and ships a great set of features... and we give them 10 dollars again. Do you think they will be happy? I'm honestly not sure, if I understood that my salary and rewards were fixed when I signed up, then I might be ok with this. It does remove rewards as a motivator to deliver more impact though, and while that is likely not everyone's only motivation, it is part of it for most people. 

Either way though, if you feel everyone did exactly as good a job (adjusting for their seniority, we shouldn't expect the same things out of a year one team member as the experienced lead), then equal rewards is the right answer. Generally that is not the case though, some people have a more positive or negative impact on the team and the work than others, and we should make sure their rewards reflect that.
