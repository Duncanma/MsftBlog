title: '"Letter from the Editor" on the MSDN Developer Centers'

Hey folks, I'm not sure if you've seen this section of the new MSDN Developer Centers (<http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/letters>). It is a place where the appropriate MSDN Content Strategist (me for VB, [Kent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/letters) for ASP.NET, etc...) gives a little blurb about the content on the site for that period of time... it is a bit bloggish in nature in fact, but with a bit more editorial polish...

Anyway, I was looking at the fairly dismal page views on this part of the vbasic site and I was wondering what would make it more appealing? Is it lack of awareness? Do you need notification through a feed? Is it the content?

Feel free to let me know! Thanks!
