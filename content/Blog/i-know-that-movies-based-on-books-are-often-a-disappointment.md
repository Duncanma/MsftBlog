title: I know that movies based on books are often a disappointment...

In many ways, I'm ok with that; it isn't like they took away the book when they made the movie...

**LOTR** is one of the few exceptions in recent times, although I also enjoyed **Timeline** (forgive me)... **Bourne Identity** might have been a good movie, I can't say because having read the book coloured my view of it too much to handle the changes... I could go on, listing off a variety of movies where I loved the book but found the movie lacking, but that isn't the point of this post.

Last night I saw a trailer for "I, Robot".

If you've seen the trailer and you've read the book(s) then you'll understand these comments without any more explanation. _What soulless person owns that book license and saw fit to sell it without any concern for what type of movie was produced?_ Wasn't there a way to turn this into a box office action flick without going completely against the basic concepts of Asimov's robot stories?

Perhaps I should wait until I see the movie before I pass judgement, but isn't going to the movie and giving them my money already saying that I think the movie is worth something?

The sad part, to me, is that I was so excited when I saw the first posters...
