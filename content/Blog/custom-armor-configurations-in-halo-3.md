title: Custom Armor Configurations in Halo 3
type: posts
---
In Halo 3 multi-player you can customize your SPARTAN or Elite's armor, with different variations unlocked by various achievements/activities in game (including one that can only be unlocked by being a Bungie employee). [You can find out more about the different variations here](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Armor_Permutations), but it turns out that [your profile on Bungie.net](http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/Default.aspx?player=Festive%20Turkey) knows what choices you've made and displays your current armor configuration on the web site.

If you go to the [Halo 3 Model Generator](http://www.zaamit.com/h3-model-generator/) though, created by a community member, you can find the picture of any particular gamer you'd like (including yourself, which is how I found my picture, below) or create a custom image to plan out your own armor customizations.

What I'd really like to create is a live URL, one like /getpicture.ashx?GamerTag=Festive+Turkey, so that I could put my picture on my site and have it automatically update as I change my armor configuration in the game... hopefully ending up like this
