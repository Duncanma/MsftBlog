title: World of Warcraft Free Trial, giving drugs to a recovering addict
type: posts

If I told you that I was a recovering alcholic, would you offer me a drink? I doubt it, unless you are a real bastard. Well, [Adam Kinney](http://www.adamkinney.com) (my boss at [on10.net](http://on10.net)) and I have been having many discussions about RPGs and MMORPGs ([Oblivion](http://adamkinney.com/blog/130/default.aspx), Asheron's Call and WoW being the main topics). I told him that I used to play a ton of AC, but I found that it was a real drain on my time and that I finally had to quit it so that I could stop spending my nights up until 2 am playing... so what does he do? He sends me a free 10-day trial to WoW.

Bastard
