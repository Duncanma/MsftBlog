title: Article about the use of glucosamine and chondroitin for joint pain...

I used to get knee pain all the time, just walking down stairs would cause quite an ache, but after I dropped some weight that went away... now it seems that pounding my legs onto the pavement over and over again is firing it back up again, and it is getting bad enough that I'm feeling reluctant to run as often as I have been. Seeing me limp my way down the stairs into the changing room, someone that I was running with mentioned glucosamine, saying that it really helps repair the damaged 'stuff' that is leading to the discomfort when I run down large hills. Well, I have no idea if it works or not, but a bit of searching turned up [a fairly detailed article about these supplements](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,5033,s6-197-0-0-8138,00.html) that makes them seem like a pretty good idea. I haven't picked any up yet, but if I do I'll let you know how it works out...
