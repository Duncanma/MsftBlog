I'm far from having used up all the gameplay in the initial release of Oblivion, and I haven't even gotten into the expansions, and now they've announced an additional expansion with a ton more gameplay that I can jump into on the 360... amazing.

I have to say that Oblivion is still the best 360 game I own, and it just keeps getting better.
