title: Hmm... maybe Chris Sells has a point, no more interviews at Microsoft
type: posts

I took [the test](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp) Chris has been [talking about](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=796), ended up as an ENTJ as well... I didn't read the descriptions before or after... but I think I get the general idea.

As Chris was saying, I bet we could come up with quite a few similar traits amongst people at Microsoft... even my son has noticed. Whenever he sees another Microsoft developer (t-shirt, glasses, maybe a little below the peak of physical fitness..) he points at them and says "Daddy!" and then giggles while pointing at various guys around the Microsoft campus and saying "more Daddy, more Daddy" ... when the well-dressed guys (must be from Marketing... or maybe the Office group) come walking by, he doesn't say a thing.
