Ok, so I must admit that the whole [Live.com/Start.com](http://www.live.com) thing looks so much like a "[Digital Dashboard](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnoxpta/html/odc_digdash.asp)" (anyone else get into that fad when it was cool?) that I feel like I'm back working on building my own components into the Outlook Today page.... but cynicism aside, it is still a cool idea and the very open system for creating and adding [your own gadgets](http://www.microsoftgadgets.com) rocks. If you are wondering how to get started, then check out [Adam Kinney's article](http://www.adamkinney.com/note.aspx?id=86) to learn exactly what you need to do.
