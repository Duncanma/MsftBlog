type: posts

Ok, so I'm fishing for comments... not compliments at least, but I'm still fishing... I've seen a fair bit of traffic to [the install point ](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/12/07/3360.aspx)but not a single email or blog comment about this app... go ahead fire away (and yes, I know that it doesn't do Atom feeds... yet).
