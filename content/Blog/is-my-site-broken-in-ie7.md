title: Is my site broken in IE7?
type: posts
---
[Matthew](http://www.bestsnowman.com) mentions [in response to an earlier post](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/12/07/3360.aspx#3367) that my site might be broken for people using the IE 7 Beta ... I don't have IE 7 installed, because I thought I should really be testing any of my work projects in IE 6 (along with Firefox and Opera), but if anyone else has it on their machine, could you let me know if you run into any problems? Contact me through the blog, or email [IE7Issues@duncanmackenzie.net](mailto:ie7issues@duncanmackenzie.net)... either way! Thanks!!
