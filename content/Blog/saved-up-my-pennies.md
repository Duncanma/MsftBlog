I've been putting money aside for a few months now, to save up for an Xbox 360, and now I have sold my media center extender (the HP one), I've hit the magical number to be able to afford the 'premium' edition. I can't afford any of the crazy bundles that are available for pre-order though, so I guess I'll be waiting for a bit to pick one up after the release on November 22nd...

What about you folks? Have you pre-ordered, did you manage to find a place that would let you pre-order just a console (is that so crazy?) ?
