A friend of mine from my MSDN days is over in MSN (oops, Windows Live I guess) land now and is working on a new product that is just going into beta... if you are interested, and perhaps would even like to be involved in the beta... [check out her post on the program here](http://blogs.msdn.com/lauraj/archive/2006/08/25/724261.aspx).
