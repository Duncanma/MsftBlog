Since I wrote this post, the Channel 9 apps across UWP, XBox, iOS and Android have all been retired

And it is available in beta now, please check it out and let me know what you think.

So, here you go, if you have a Windows Phone 8 and have any interest in Channel 9 type content:

Just using the app [generates telemetry that is useful](http://markedup.com), but please reply with any direct feedback you have to me and I’ll consolidate.

If you have a Channel 9 account, you can swipe over to the panel marked “More”, pick Settings and sign into your account. This will let you rate videos and add them to your Queue, but otherwise the app is fully functional without signing in.

This is a beta, and we know some features and stability is still missing, so don’t be surprised if you hit a few issues. And if it crashes, we get that data, so your pain is our gain!



_Note that we’ve decided to have the wonderful folks at [HiddenPineapple](http://hiddenpineapple.com/) publish this Beta as its own app, which means that when we release a final version (which will be a 1<sup>st</sup> party app, after the code has been transitioned to my team) you won’t be auto-updated…. sorry about that!_

Thanks!
