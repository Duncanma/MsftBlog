[Adam Nathan](http://blogs.msdn.com/adam_nathan) (author of [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067232170X/duncanmackenz-20?creative=125581&#038;camp=2321&#038;link_code=as1)) and the overall master of Interop between managed and unmanaged code, blogged last week about his [CLR SPY](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=c7b955c7-231a-406c-9fa5-ad09ef3bb37f) tool. If you haven't seen it, download it from GotDotNet and let him know what you think (through [the comments on his blog entry](http://blogs.msdn.com/adam_nathan/archive/2004/01/13/58308.aspx#FeedBack)).

The Whidbey CLR will have a larger set of CLR Debug Probes (CDPs) than what v1.1 has, and these will all be exposed in the updated tool, of course.  But do find the “monitoring“ behavior of the tool useful?  Are the balloon notifications annoying?  etc. etc.
