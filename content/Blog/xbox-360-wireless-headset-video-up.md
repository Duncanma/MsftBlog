As [I mentioned before](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/wireless-headset-for-the-xbox-360/), I had a chance to chat with the PM for the [Xbox 360 Wireless Headset](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZFCZQ?ie=UTF8&tag=duncanmackenz-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=B000HZFCZQ) and now [that interview is up on on10.net](http://on10.net/Blogs/duncan/xbox-360-wireless-headset/).

Remember, the headset is releasing just in time for Gears of War (November 7th). Coincidence? I think not!
