title: A burning desire
type: posts

Every time I go to a computer/electronics store I consider buying some [mini-CD-Rs](https://www.maxell-data.com/cgi-bin/products.cgi?parent=48), but I have absolutely no reason to get them. But, I still look at them every time. I just want to burn something on them. Something that would fit into 210mb, something "cool" to send to a friend.. I'll admit it, I just want to buy them because they look cute.
