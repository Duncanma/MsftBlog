title: a new "henge"
type: posts
---
[SQLServerCentral.com](http://sqlservercentral.com/newsletter/)'s newsletter included a link to [a newly built ring similar in many ways to Stonehenge](http://www.astronomynz.org.nz/stonehenge/stonehenge.htm)... overall it looks like a really cool project to illustrate how this technology was originally used. Someday, a similar project will be formed to recreate a massive scale version of a P4, that you can walk through and pretend to be electrons... people of the time will be stunned to hear that anything so primitive actually performed calculations ðŸ™‚
