I've been thinking about books and the MSDN developer centers for some time... I've been wondering what we should do in terms of highlighting books on the MSDN site.

  * Do you want **reviews**?
      * **Top x Books** by topic area (Beginning VB.NET, Data Access, Windows Forms, Language Focused...)? How would "Top" be determined though? Top could be sales #s, votes on some sort of dynamic site (which one, who should host this... INETA, [http://www.dotnetbooks.com](http://www.dotnetbooks.com/)) ?
          * **My favorite books?** (which means [Chris's](http://www.sellsbrothers.com) favorites on [Longhorn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn), Kent's on [ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net), [Brian's](http://weblogs.asp.net/brianjo) on [C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc), etc...)
              * **MVP Reviews**?
                  * **No books** at all? (You'll just use other sites to find .NET books?)
                      * **Sample Chapters**?
                          * Or, should we just **feature them all** (by topic) and rotate them through for highlighting?

I could set up a poll for this, but I think the discussion will be more useful so please use the comments section to voice your thoughts!!
