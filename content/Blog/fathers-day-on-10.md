title: Father's Day on 10
type: posts

We ran [a father's day themed bit on 10 on Friday](http://on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/3569/), but if you are into gadgets you'll probably like it regardless of the day. I like the Superman laptop from Alienware, the rather simplistic graphic appeals to me. For the desktops, I believe I liked the [Star Wars ones](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/05/01/1403.aspx) better, but they no longer seem to be available. (actually, I couldn't find any info about them on the site... but I tried out [the old links](http://www.alienware.com/starwars_pages/awswaurora.aspx) and they seemed to still work...) Of course, the most appealing thing is probably the wi-fi finder... it is a bit more in my price range than the other gadgets... actually it isn't, but the cheaper wi-fi spotters probably are.
