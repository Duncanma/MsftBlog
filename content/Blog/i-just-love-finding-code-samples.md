title: I just love finding code samples :)
type: posts

[Aaron Brethorst](http://www.brethorsting.com/mt3/) has a little page of his code samples up at [http://www.brethorsting.com/code/](http://www.brethorsting.com/code/) which include a few interesting items including **a software version of the Enigma machine in C#**. Cool stuff. Aaron is also the author of [iRooster, an alarm clock application (that uses playlists from iTunes)](http://www.sixdollarchimp.com/) which also looks neat, but runs on the Mac so it isn't something that I have any real use for... :).
