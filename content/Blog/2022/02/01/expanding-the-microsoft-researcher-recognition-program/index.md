The [Microsoft Researcher Recognition Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program) offers public thanks and recognition to security researchers who help protect our customers through discovering and sharing security vulnerabilities under [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd).

Today, we are expanding the program to recognize more security researchers in more ways for their contributions to protecting customers, and we published the first new leaderboard on our [program page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program).

**Highlights**

1. Leaderboard: Every quarter, our leaderboard will recognize any researcher who receives more than 20 points during each recognition period, allowing for Microsoft to publicly thank and recognize not just the top 5% of researchers, but all researchers who have successfully helped us protect customers each quarter.
2. Research area-specific leaderboards: To help researchers see and connect with others who are passionate in similar technology areas, our research area-specific leaderboards will recognize researchers who have submitted high impact vulnerabilities in a particular products like Azure, Windows, and more.
3. Badges: We are introducing digital badges to further highlight researchers’ accomplishments and help build their professional portfolios, resumes, and social media presence. Badges will include, becoming a Most Valuable Security Researcher (MVR), achieving a high accuracy score, and much more!
4. Clear and simple program guidelines: Based on feedback from our researcher community, we’ve updated our [Microsoft Researcher Recognition Program page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program) to provide clearer and simpler guidance on how points work, listed some of the most frequently asked questions, and created a lasting page where each leaderboard will be published.
