title: Another interesting product from Roku
type: posts
---
I was pretty impressed with the [first Roku offering](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/hd1000/index.php), a HDTV focused media player that included "art packs" to use your HDTV flat panel as artwork... not that I have one of those flat LCD or Plasma displays... but the idea was appealing. Now they've come out with the [Soundbridge](http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/index.php) (a networked audio device) and I'm impressed again.

Disclaimer: I haven't actually _seen_ either of these products, just the specs on the site, but the feature set and design are interesting.
