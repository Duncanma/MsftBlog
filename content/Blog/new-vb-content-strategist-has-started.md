title: New VB Content Strategist has started...
type: posts
---
A while ago I moved out of the Content Strategist role and over onto the development team at MSDN, but until this week my position had remained empty! Well, the wait is over, Brad McCabe has joined the illustrious content strategist team at MSDN. No 'official' link to point you to yet, but I'm sure a blog will follow soon!

Of course, a <strike>google</strike> [MSN search](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=Brad+McCabe+.NET&FORM=QBRE) turns up a variety of [articles](http://www.aspnetpro.com/NewsletterArticle/2003/08/asp200308bm_l/asp200308bm_l.asp) and speaking appearances... even a [bio](http://www.gulfcoastdotnet.org/uploads/BradMcCabeSpeakerBio.pdf)!

As a side note, this means that my blog will be leaving the Visual Basic home page in the near future, so if you are interested in keeping track of my posts, you might want to bookmark my personal site at http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma

**Update:** Of course, no sooner do I post that I don't have a blog link, and he goes and starts a blog: <http://blogs.msdn.com/Brad_McCabe> ðŸ™‚
