Partial types have come up [a few times lately](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2004/07/13/1403.aspx), and I wasn't sure they had been explained/defined before... so, I stole some prose from another document on this topic, cut and pasted some VB code from VS 2005 and [here you go](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/articles/184459.aspx)
