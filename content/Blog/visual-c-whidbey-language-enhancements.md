type: posts
---
If you think we are talking about Whidbey too much... don't read this post ðŸ™‚

The powerpoints and demos are both online for Anders Hejlsberg's talk on the changes to C# for the Whidbey release:

> In "Whidbey", the Visual C# language will be extended with a variety of constructs across a broad spectrum of research and industy languages. Learn the ins and outs of how generics provide improved code reuse, iterators simplify implementation of enumerator patterns, anonymous methods ease work with delegates, and partial types provide easier development and code maintenance. See how these and other language enhancements deliver "code-focused" RAD for Visual C# developers.
