title: Interested in Investigating Indigo?
type: posts
---
[Scott Seely](http://blogs.msdn.com/scottseely), a former MSDN co-worker of mine and now a member of the Indigo team, is working on a new Indigo book with Brian Nantz. The book won't be out for a while, but you can get a lot of advance information (including some of the chapters), by watching for updates on [www.thatindigobook.com](http://www.thatindigobook.com). Should be a great way to get a free taste of some Indigo content right from someone who works on the code...
