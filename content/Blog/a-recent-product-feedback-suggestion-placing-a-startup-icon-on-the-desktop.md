title: A recent Product Feedback suggestion "Placing a Startup Icon on the Desktop"
type: posts
---
"Dynamic Systems" recently submitted [a suggestion ](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=eaca3508-aaa6-4de3-87a9-9282df66238f)into the [MSDN Product Feedback system](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback), looking for a way to add a shortcut (link to their app) to the user's desktop, startup folder or other location.... well, I don't have a built-in .NET Framework answer for that, but there is a relevant Code Project article available...
