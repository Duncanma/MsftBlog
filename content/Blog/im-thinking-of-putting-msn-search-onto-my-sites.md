title: I'm thinking of putting MSN Search onto my site(s)
type: posts
---
With their [SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msn/msnsearch/), [search results as RSS](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=MSDN+site%3aduncanmackenzie.net&format=rss&FORM=RSRE), and ability to limit searches by site (so you can do queries like [MSDN site:duncanmackenzie.net](http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=MSDN+site%3Aduncanmackenzie.net&FORM=QBRE)), I think I'll be able to provide a nice little 'cross property' search for my blog and my personal site. Replacing the google search box on my site isn't a big priority for me, but writing this widget might be useful to other folks as well... but until MSN gets an AdSense like program, Google is likely to own at least a part of my web site real estate ðŸ™‚
