title: Interesting phrase...

Just heard an advertisement on the radio for the [Foo Fighters ](http://www.foofighters.com)and it contained this quote "The world's best American rock band..."</span>

What does that mean? Don't "world's best" and "American" clash a little there? Wouldn't "Best American Rock Band" be a better phrase? This isn't a shot at the band at all (or American rock bands, if that is a category of music at all), I like their music; I'm just mocking the phrasing... are there are bands that are classified as "American rock bands" that aren't from <?xml:namespace
prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"
/?><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>? I'm assuming this phrase is

 somehow related to the Grammy that they just won, but I believe it was for [Best Hard Rock Performance](http://entertainment.msn.com/news/article.aspx?news=111227)...</span><o:p></o:p>
