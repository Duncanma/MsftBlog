Thanks to the work of Serge Baranovsky (the guy behind VBCity) a new site is up that aggregates content from various Visual Basic related sources, including personal and team blogs from both inside and outside of Microsoft. Check out the launch annoucement [here](http://vbfeeds.com/post.aspx?id=522), and check out [the site](http://vbfeeds.com) as soon as you can.
