I only have one firewire device, my camcorder, and 2 ports on my machine... but I think I should get [this](http://www.thinkgeek.com/cubegoodies/toys/5b55/) anyway... the eyes light-up when it is connected to your 1394 port!

Now, if they had one that was a network hub, it would be cool and I might actually hook something into it.
