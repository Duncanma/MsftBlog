> I flew to Boston last week and sat down with [Dr. Ian Davis](http://www.maddocsoftware.com/about_team_bio.htm), the Mad Doctor himself, CEO and Founder of [Mad Doc Software](http://www.maddocsoftware.com/) to talk about their upcoming game "[Star Trek Legacy](http://www.maddocsoftware.com/games_st_legacy.htm)" for the PC and the 360. We chatted about Star Trek games, Artificial Intelligence and Bulldogs... not in any particular order. This is just part 1 of my trip to Mad Doc, more gameplay footage of both the single and multi-player game is coming soon!
