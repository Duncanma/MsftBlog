description: A few years ago I had my first european craft beer experience, at a cool little craft beer place in Barcelona
draft: true

Years ago I was in Barcelona for a conference, TechEd Europe 2014 I believe, and it was one of the first times I decided to try and find some craft beer in Europe. Luckily a few web searches came back with two spots, the Cat Bar and Ale&Hop. Over the past 5 years though, the number of places you can go has really blown up, so if you are heading there now I would check out a [more up-to-date guide to Craft Beer in Barcelona](https://www.barcelonafoodexperience.com/blog/best-craft-beer-barcelona).

## Cat Bar

This was my favorite find, despite the fact that the staff couldn't answer any questions at all about the beers. Everyone spoke english, but all of my questions about where each beer was from, what was local, etc. just produced confused looks until the owner wandered over and sat down. He filled me in, and recommended the vegan burger, which was great. Really felt like a hidden spot, down a very narrow alley. Sadly very little info on their website, so [you have to go to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CatBarCAT).
