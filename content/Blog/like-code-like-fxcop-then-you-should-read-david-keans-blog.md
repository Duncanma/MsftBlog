title: Like Code? Like FxCop? Then you should read David Kean's blog...
type: posts

I was reading [an entry from David Kean about some inconsistencies in 2.0 Framework classes](http://managedfromdownunder.blogspot.com/2004/08/net-20-inconsistencies.html), and I decided to jump up a level and read through some of his others posts... holy code samples, Batman! Seriously, almost every post includes a code or XML sample of some sort... that is a high signal-to-noise ratio folks... all on fairly interesting .NET topics, including quite a few discussions of [FxCop](http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/fxcop/)... you should definitely check this blog out (link below)....
