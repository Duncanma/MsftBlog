title: Lots of folks interested in the free Xbox 360 link...
type: posts

For the last few weeks I've had a graphic and link to a ['free Xbox 360' site](http://xbox360s.freepay.com/?r=23139488) up as a banner on my blog pages, and it has received a lot of clicks (and 12 or so sign-ups, although no one has completed an offer yet...). I'm guessing that with the difficulty of obtaining a pre-order at this close to the release, the idea of a free Xbox 360 is pretty appealing. Personally, I headed down to the local EB Games and put down a $50 deposit on an Xbox 360 in one of their future allotments (all the machines in the first allotment were already pre-sold). I figured that if I didn't do that, I'd be driving around to Walmart and Toys R' Us for days before I managed to find a machine for sale at the end of November.
