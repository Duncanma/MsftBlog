title: So many posts in so little time...
type: posts

[Cyrus](http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn) (a developer with the C# IDE team) has obviously needed to blog for awhile, and when he finally did, he had a lot of material ready to go. Check out [his 28 posts from the last 2 days](http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2004/05.aspx)!

Here's his first post:

    <b> <a id="viewpost.ascx_TitleUrl" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2004/05/15/132639.aspx">First blog entry</a> </b>A couple of week ago I worked with Jay and Kevin on a little mental exercise. It was a lot of fun to do and you can read about it here: [LazyLoader](http://weblogs.asp.net/jaybaz_ms/archive/2004/05/07/128185.aspx)

      After that I found myself responding to several posters about design decisions we made and the usefulness of the library we'd written. I figured it was kind of silly to be having these conversations in the feedback section of another blog (especially as we were starting to branch out onto new topics). So it seemed natural to start my own blog at this point.
