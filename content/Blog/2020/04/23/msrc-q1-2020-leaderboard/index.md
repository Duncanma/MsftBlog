Each quarterly leaderboard recognizes the security researchers who ranked at or above the 95th percentile based on their total points. This Q1 2020 leaderboard reflects point values for cases that are:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- Submitted and assessed by the MSRC team between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2020
- Submitted between October 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 ([last program period](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/01/15/msrc-q4-2019-leaderboard/)), but assessed after January 1, 2020

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With just over two months until the end of the program period, there’s still an opportunity to work toward becoming one of this year’s **Most Valuable Security Researchers**! Check out our [blog post](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/02/03/recognizing-security-researchers-in-2020/) for full details on the multipliers and high value targets that can maximize the points you receive for each case.

**Keep up the great work! We look forward to seeing you in the next quarterly leaderboard!**
