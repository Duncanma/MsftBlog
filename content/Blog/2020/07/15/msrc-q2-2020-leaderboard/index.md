Each quarterly leaderboard recognizes the top five percent of security researchers, based on their total points. This Q2 2020 leaderboard reflects point values for cases that are:

- Submitted and assessed by the MSRC team between April 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020
- Submitted between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2020 ([last program period](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/04/23/msrc-q1-2020-leaderboard/)), but assessed after April 1, 2020

Keep up the great work! We look forward to seeing you in the next leaderboard!
