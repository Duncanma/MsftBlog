**Today we announce our Most Valuable Security Researchers for 2020!**

The [MSRC Researcher Recognition program](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/researcher-recognition-program) is an integral aspect of recognizing the ongoing partnerships with our community of talented security researchers who report through [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/cvd). These recognitions run throughout specific periods of the year and provide regular opportunities to recognize those who have the greatest impact on the security environment.

Every year during Black Hat USA, we take time to recognize our Most Valuable Security Researchers (MVRs) based on the _volume_, as well as the _accuracy_ and _impact of their vulnerability reports_. While we cannot come together physically to celebrate their accomplishments, the researchers listed in today’s announcement have made exceptional contributions to the overall security of Microsoft’s customers between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020, one of the most challenging periods in recent history.

We are thrilled that so many researchers achieved this status and join those who were recognized as the [2019 Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/). We can’t wait to see what our researchers do in the coming year!
