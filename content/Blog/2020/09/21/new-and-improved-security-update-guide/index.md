We’re excited to announce a significant update to the _[Security Update Guide](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide)_, our one-stop site for information about all security updates provided by Microsoft. This new version will provide a more intuitive user experience to help protect our customers regardless of what Microsoft products or services they use in their environment. We’ve listened to your feedback and incorporated many of your suggestions and new feature ideas. For example, it is now much easier to get a simple list of all CVEs being released on an Update Tuesday or between your own custom date range (see **Vulnerabilities** tab). Additionally, you can now quickly get a unique list of downloadable patches along with links to Release Notes and KB Articles (see **Deployments** tab). Finally, you can select columns to personalize your display (see **Edit Columns**), and you can even switch to Dark Mode if you prefer (see **Theme **control in menu).
