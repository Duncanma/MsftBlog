We are pleased to announce the launch of the [Xbox Bounty program today](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-xbox)[.]()

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The Xbox bounty program invites gamers, security researchers, and technologists around the world to help identify security vulnerabilities in the Xbox network and services, and share them with the Microsoft Xbox team through [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd). Eligible submissions with a clear and concise proof of concept (POC) are eligible for awards up to** US\$20,000**.

Since launching in 2002, the [Xbox network](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/gold#) has enabled millions of users to share their common love of gaming on a safe and secure service. The bounty program supplements our existing investments in security development and testing to uncover and remediate vulnerabilities which have a direct and demonstrable impact on the security of Xbox customers. Public bounty programs are a valuable approach which combine with ongoing internal testing, private programs and knowledge shared by partners to produce a secure ecosystem to play in.
