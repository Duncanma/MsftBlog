title: New "Coding 4 Fun" article is up...
type: posts
---
Should be up and live already so here is the URL: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun08222003.asp>

If you diff this article with the pieces from my blog... you will see the work of [Henry Borys](http://ajayan.com/aboutajayan.htm), the excellent editor of these columns (and a ton of other MSDN material)... the changes are generally small, but critical.

One example.... he didn't like my name (Keeping Work Fun) so we now have [Developing Priorities: Fun First](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun08222003.asp)
