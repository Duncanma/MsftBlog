[ <b>Part 3: Binary Trees and BSTs</b> ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/datastructures_guide3.asp)



This article, the third in a six-part series on data structures in the .NET Framework, looks at a common data structure that is not included in the .NET Framework Base Class Library: binary trees. Whereas arrays arrange data linearly, binary trees can be envisioned as storing data in two dimensions. A special kind of binary tree, called a binary search tree, or BST, allows for a much more optimized search time than with arrays.
