The theme at my son's preschool last week was Caterpillars, and it also happened to be his turn to bring the snack (the kids rotate through this task, bring snacks/juice for 16 people)... so my wife went all-out and baked these breadstick-larva creations...

Very yummy and supposedly quite well received by the kids...
