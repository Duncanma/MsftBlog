    _I’ve coined the phrase ‘object span’ to describe the ability to front load a graph-based query with enough information to cherry pick at the best bits of data so data retrieval is optimized to the application.<span deactivatedstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve even written about that _ [ <font color="#6666cc"> _here_  ](http://blogs.msdn.com/mattwar/archive/2004/03/15/90275.aspx) _.<span deactivatedstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet I’ve never felt one hundred percent right about any of it.<span deactivatedstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not the span exactly, but the whole concept of systems designed to retrieve segments of a data graph into the client space, with interceptors (or swizzlers) that fault in more segments upon demand.<span deactivatedstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve come to the conclusion that demand loading is just a terribly bad idea._
