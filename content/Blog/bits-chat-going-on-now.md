[Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) API](http://communities2.microsoft.com/home/chatroom.aspx?siteid=34000014)


This chat will provide participants the opportunity to ask questions about the BITS API. We will also discuss new features that are planned for upcoming releases. Participants can discuss scenarios in which they use BITS and identify features that would help them.
