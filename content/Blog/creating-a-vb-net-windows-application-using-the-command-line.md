title: Creating a VB.NET Windows application using the command line
type: posts

**Juanito27** posted this question to [the VB.NET forum on GotDotNet](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/MessageBoard.aspx?id=8) last week...

> [<b>Command line compile Windows vb app</b>](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/MessageBoard/Thread.aspx?id=261516&Page=1)

> I need to have someone show me how to compile via command line a vb.net windows app. Could someone show me the minimum code to get a window/form up with maybe a label or button on it.

so I posted up a sample to [the samples page on my personal site](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/samples/commandline/) that shows creating two programs via the VB.NET command line compiler... first a console application, then a Windows Forms app... this page is a draft version of something I'm putting together for MSDN so let me know if you find it useful...
