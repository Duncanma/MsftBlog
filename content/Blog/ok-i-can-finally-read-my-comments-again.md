title: Ok... I can finally read my comments again...
type: posts

I'm sure I'll be one of many commenting on this, but [the recent updates to .Text on this site](http://weblogs.asp.net/sitenews/archive/2004/08/07/210728.aspx) are a wonderful improvement. For the past while I had been unable to really sift out the good comments from the bad, so real (non-spam) comments to the VB or C# FAQ sites, and to this blog... were all being drowned out by all of the spam. Keeping up with it (to delete the spam) was almost impossible and I gave up some time ago ...

We'll see how it goes, but I'm hoping these changes make these blogs sites a less attractive target for spam.
