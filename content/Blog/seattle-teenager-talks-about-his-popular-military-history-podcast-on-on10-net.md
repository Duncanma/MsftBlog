My wife had read about this cool guy when working on a new article for Parent Map (["Help kids handle use of handhelds"](http://parentmap.com/june_06/0606_2c.htm)) and I was intrigued, so [Jesse](http://www.osakasteve.com) and I took a trip over to Seattle and [interviewed him for on10.net](http://on10.net/Blogs/Raw/3420/). It is a slightly different style of video than what you are used to from on10.net, but you can expect to see a wide variety of topics and styles on the site over time. This is also Jesse's first video on 10, so let us know what you thought!
