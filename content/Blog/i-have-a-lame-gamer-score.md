title: I have a lame gamer score
type: posts

80 now I think, after a quick bit of [Ridge Racer](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/r/ridgeracer6/).... but an overall low score. I'm told that I need to just play more games, but we'll see how I do with my current set of  PDZ, PGR3,DOA4 and Ridge Racer. Ridge Racer is a really different racing experience than PGR3, where I've been spending most of my time... not sure if I like it yet, but I'll give it a bit of time, that's the whole reason I get these games through GameFly ... try before you buy.
