title: It seems referral swapping is the way to go... but you end up signed up for a bunch more sites
type: posts

I signed up for [RefStop](http://www.refstop.com/register.htm?r=Duncanma), where you create a list of the current 'free offer' sites that you have accounts with and then you are matched up with folks who can do a referral for you in return for you doing one for them... and it works pretty good, I now have 5 out of the 8 I need for [the Free Flat Screen offer](http://www.FreeFlatScreens.com/?r=13882371), and 7 out of the 10 I need for [the Mac Mini site](http://www.macminis4free.com/default.aspx?r=171215) (from which I actually have selected the $450 paypal offer, not the mini mac itself ... this is a nice feature of any of the sites run by OfferCentric, they all have a Pay Pal option instead of the standard items). In the process though, I ended up signing up for a ton of trial offers (full list of the sites I have accounts with is [here](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=61)). Columbia House, BMG music, even AOL ðŸ™‚

Some of the trial offers have been completely worth it though, I signed up for [Audible.com](http://www.Audible.com) and burned the 3-CDs worth of audio for "[Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/duncanmackenz-20?creative=327641&#038;camp=14573&#038;link_code=as1)" and listening to that type of book is certainly is a nice way to spend the drive into work...
