type: posts

Over in the Office side of the world, a set of 6 labs have been released, focused on learning how to use VB.NET and C# to create Office solutions with Office 2003 and Visual Studio Tools for Office... cool stuff if Office development is your thing (and it certainly is [mine](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/books/))...

> The training labs in this section step you through the process of creating and working with Microsoft&reg; Office Word 2003 and Microsoft Office Excel 2003 solutions using Microsoft Visual Studio&reg; Tools for the Microsoft Office System. Visual Basic&reg; .NET code is used in all labs except Lab 6, which contains Visual C#&reg; code.
