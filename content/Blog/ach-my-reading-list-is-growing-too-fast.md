title: Ach... my reading list is growing too fast...
type: posts
---
Just today, I've added the new ["Smart Client Offline Application Block"](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/offline.asp) (from PAG), [FotoVision](http://msdn.microsoft.com/smartclient/codesamples/fotovision/), these [articles by Cliff Atkinson about PowerPoint](http://www.sociablemedia.com/articles_list.htm)... and I brought home Murach's ["ASP.NET Web Programming with VB.NET"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1890774200/duncanmackenz-20?creative=125581&camp=2321&link_code=as1) to start reading _in my spare time..._ While all of these things, and especially that book, look great... adding 3 or 4 things a day without any scheduled time to work at reducing the list, just isn't going to scale...

On the bright side, I don't think folks in our business are facing any real **shortage** of great information these days.
