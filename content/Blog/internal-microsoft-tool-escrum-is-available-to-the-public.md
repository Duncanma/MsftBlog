We (the dev team behind [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/), [Channel 10](http://on10.net/), [Mix Online](http://www.visitmix.com/), and [others](http://www.mscommunities.com/)[...](http://channel8.msdn.com/))been doing scrum-ish development for a few sprints now, but we recently switched to using [eScrum](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=55A4BDE6-10A7-4C41-9938-F388C1ED15E9&displaylang=en). This is a set of templates and tools for use with Team Foundation Server and it really rocks. There are few less-than-polished elements about the install and the web interface, but I'm glad they shipped it out for general use.

You can read [a good summary of eScrum](http://devmatter.blogspot.com/2007/06/quick-escrum-review.html) on the blog 'A Developer's Life', which is also a good resource for lots of other Visual Studio related news.
