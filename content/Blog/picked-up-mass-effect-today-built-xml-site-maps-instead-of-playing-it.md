title: Picked up Mass Effect today... built XML site maps instead of playing it :(
type: posts
---
I'm very excited about it... really! I just got distracted on <http://sitemaps.org> and ended up building [a site map for this site](http://duncanmackenzie.net/Sitemap.ashx)... real brute force, just grabbed all the blog entries and tags and output the appropriate absolute paths into some objects that I then wrote out into an XML document. Same method wouldn't work on [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com) though, it has too many entries, so I'll need to move to a site map index with multiple sub site maps... now I just have to figure out how to divide the entries up (by tag, by type of content, by date?).
