In yet another great article from CodeProject, [Julijan Sribar describes the details of drawing out a 3D Pie Chart](http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/JulijanPieChart.asp), and not only does it work, but his explanation is exteremely clear, detailed and includes lots of diagrams that really add to the explanation.
