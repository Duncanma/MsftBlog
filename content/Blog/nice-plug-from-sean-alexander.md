title: Nice plug from Sean Alexander...
type: posts

[Sean](http://EraBlog.NET/filters/12154.post) mentions my [last article,](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun04252003.asp) which was all about [the new WMP 9 "blogging" plug-in.](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/expertzone/columns/robinson/03april17.asp) To answer the question asked in [his comments](http://blogs.eraserver.net/blogs/sean/default.aspx?eraPostID=12154#comments), yes... grabbing the dll and regsvr32'ing it will allow it to work on Windows Server 2003... or even on Longhorn if [you](http://www.sellsbrothers.com) are into that sort of thing...

Of course, I'd suggest that you don't run WMP9, IE, or blogging client software on your Windows Server, but I don't want to sound _crazy_
