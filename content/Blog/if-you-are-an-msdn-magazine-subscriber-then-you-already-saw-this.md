My Advanced Basics column from the October 2004 issue is now up online...

> **[Building a Progress Bar that Doesn't Progress](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/10/AdvancedBasics/default.aspx)**

and if you think that title is odd, here is what [Chris Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com) had to say when he first heard it... (comments used 100% without permission, but I figure he won't mind)...

> _"I canâ€™t wait to read 'Building a Progress Bar that Doesn't Progress.' I assume follow on articles will cover 'Building a Button that Doesn't Butt' and 'Building a Status Bar that Doesn't Stat?' : )"_

yep, it is great having him on the team...
