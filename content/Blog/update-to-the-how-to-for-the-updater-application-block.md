title: Update to the How-To for the Updater Application Block
type: posts
---
I posted a walkthrough of using the Updater Application Block onto my blog back in the summer but Zac Hamilton has made some changes/improvements....

> I took the Duncan Mackenzie Blog located at: [http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/story/10221.aspx](http://weblogs.asp.net/duncanma/story/10221.aspx), reworked it and added some things I was having a problems with (some of which I was able to find through this message board.)
