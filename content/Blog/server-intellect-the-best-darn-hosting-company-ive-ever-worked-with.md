title: Server Intellect... the best darn hosting company I've ever worked with
type: posts
---
I've mentioned it [before](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2004/09/02/626.aspx), but it is worth saying again. When I decided to build my site up from its static beginnings and add on various asp.net-driven [applications](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/Forums/), I needed a host that provided SQL Server database access for a reasonable fee and easerve ([Server Intellect](http://www.serverintellect.com/host/duncanma/)'s old name) came [highly recommended](http://www.pinvoke.net). Turns out to be the best hosting decision I have ever made.

Once I realized the level of support and stability that this host provided, I decided to move my personal blog onto my own installation of .Text at [http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net](). At the time, my blog was being used to populate the Visual Basic and C# developer center home pages at MSDN (and it is still used for the VB home page), so it was very "mission critical" for my job and for the site. The [Visual Basic developer center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic) is one of the most popular pages on a very high-traffic site; I was placing a lot of faith on Server Intellect's ability to deliver my content reliably. I haven't had a single issue with the uptime or performance of my feed since that time, so I guess my faith was well placed. At one point, due to a little bug at the MSDN side of things, my feed wasn't even being cached and was retrieved once for every single hit to the VB and C# developer centers.... so Server Intellect contacted me and let me know that they were removing my bandwidth cap to make sure I didn't run into any issues until we could resolve the issue on the MSDN side....

Anyway, enough gushing, here's my point: I'm very happy with [my web host](http://www.serverintellect.com/host/duncanma/), and I don't think I would have felt comfortable moving my blog off of [blogs.msdn.com](http://blogs.msdn.com) onto any other company's servers.... if that information helps you to pick a web host of your own, that's great :), especially if you end up running a bunch of ASP.NET code on your new site!
