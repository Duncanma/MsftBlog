title: Update on the free stuff...
type: posts
---
I few people emailed me to ask if the various free (referral based) offers out there are working for me... well, yes and no. I have 4 out of the 8 referrals required for [a free flat screen](http://www.freeflatscreens.com/?r=13882371), 1 out of 11 for the [free mini mac](http://www.freeminimacs.com/?r=13892191) and none for the [free Personal Video Player](http://www.pvps4free.com/default.aspx?r=160508)... which makes sense actually, I blogged about the first, I've never really talked about the mini mac one, but there is a little button link on this page so it gets a little bit of traffic, and I have never before mentioned the video player one... so it isn't getting any traffic at all.

There is hope that [the conga line concept](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/01/13/990.aspx) will work though; in the end the best bet might be to just sign up for a few of these congas and then try to ignore the whole thing and be pleasantly surprised if you get anything at all ðŸ™‚
