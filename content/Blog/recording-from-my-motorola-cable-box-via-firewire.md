title: Recording from my Motorola Cable Box via Firewire?
type: posts
---
I had no idea this was possible, but has anyone managed to either:

  1. Pull video off of their Motorola HD DVR cable box onto XP/Vista?
  2. Hook up the DVR using Firewire to a Media Center Edition box?

I'm currently using a IR Blaster and the standard definition outputs on the Motorola box to connect my cable box to my MCE 2005 XP box... works, but the quality isn't great... but then I found [this guide to firewire connections](http://home.comcast.net/~timmmoore/firewire/readme.htm)
