type: posts
---
I haven't had to write a parser since university, but if I had to write one now I'd definitely be checking out Tommy Carlier's [10 part series showing how to write a parser for a demo programming language of his own creation](http://tommycarlier.blogspot.com/2007/05/writing-parser-overview.html).
