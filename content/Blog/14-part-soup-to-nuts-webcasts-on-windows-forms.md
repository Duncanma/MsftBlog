> Tune in and learn how to build Windows Forms applications and smart clients in .NET. We’ll take you through all the steps to building an application, from start to finish, as we cover object oriented concepts and delve deep into .NET. During this series of webcasts, you will learn how to create rich user interfaces and access data, and see industry-proven ways to get Windows Forms applications to market quickly. And after viewing the webcasts, work hands-on in the MSDN Virtual Lab.
