title: Ice Cube talking about Silverlight...
type: posts
---
and the Group Manager of Platform Evangelism at Adobe feels the need to comment about it.

Let me summarize. [Ice Cube is involved in an Internet video project and has chosen to use Silverlight](http://blogs.msdn.com/synergist/archive/2007/11/20/ice-cube-s-uvntv-com-goes-live-with-silverlight.aspx), and you can watch an interview with him about it in Silverlight. (on a side note, I decided not to include the video into my post, even though the instructions to do so are right there in the original blog entry, because it is set to auto-start when someone visits the page and I think that is just downright rude ðŸ™‚ )

The post is interesting, the video is interesting... but what is really interesting is the fun going on in the comments on that blog entry, including comments from Mike Downey of Adobe and Scott Barnes of Microsoft... fun stuff. The old 'if you have nothing nice to say...' rule probably should have been applied for both of them.
