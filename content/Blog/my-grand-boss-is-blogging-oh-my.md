<font face="Verdana" color="#008080">Sara Williams, <strike>overlord</strike> manager of MSDN, has started [her own blog](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/saraw). I'm sure this will be a great place for discussion around MSDN futures and features. I know that many people who read my blog use MSDN every day, so I expect to see lots of comments!
