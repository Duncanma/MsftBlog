Which isn't a big deal, but it is amazing to me that [the same comic](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/09/18) can sometimes make me produce some form of giggle/snort/outburst every single time I see it. After viewing this comic once, I was going back and forth between browsers and it ended up coming up a few different times. Maybe four times. I laughed every time.

On a related note, these [two](http://xkcd.com/c155.html) [comics](http://xkcd.com/c135.html) produce the same effect... especially when viewed together.
