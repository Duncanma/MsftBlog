> A while ago Eric asked “[Who are the best C# bloggers external to MS?](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/04/23/119094.aspx)” which sparked a similar question in my own mind: Who are the best VB bloggers external to MS? I have my own opinions, but I'm interested to see who people find helpful and/or interesting. Just add your comments and I'll post a list later this months...
