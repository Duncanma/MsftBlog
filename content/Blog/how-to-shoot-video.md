For all you wanna-be ENG folks, video interviewers, YouTube/Soapbox producers, etc... you need this video. I need this video... we all need this video.

Tina Wood, formerly of G4 and a host of our show on <http://on10.net>, worked with Scott Finley (our cameraman extraordinaire) to produce a [how-to video about shooting a standard interview/product demo](http://on10.net/Blogs/tina/how-to-shoot-video/)... and it rocks. It also happens to be entertaining. For bonus points, to prove you watched it all the way through, feel free to discuss Tina's favorite food in the comment section!
