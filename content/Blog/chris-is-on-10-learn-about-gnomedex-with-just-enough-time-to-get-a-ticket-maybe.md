type: posts

[Chris Pirillo is on 10 today](http://on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/3518/), chatting about Gnomedex, his tendency to write things on his chest, and more. I don't know Chris myself, but I joined his "[FatBlasters](http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/06/05/50-weight-loss-tips/)" mailing list awhile ago as part of my ongoing quest to lose weight... and also as a way to get emails from Chris in my Inbox every few days ðŸ™‚

[Oooh, just noticed he has a Torrent setup for Vista as well, cool stuff](http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/06/11/windows-vista-bittorrent-tracker/)
