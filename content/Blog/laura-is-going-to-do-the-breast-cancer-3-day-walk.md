from their site:

> The Breast Cancer 3-Day is a 60-mile walk over the course of three days. Net proceeds benefit Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the National Philanthropic Trust, funding important breast cancer research, education, screening, and treatment.

Laura will be walking for 3-days, and I'll be hanging out with the kids... we all must do our part ðŸ™‚

If you'd like to donate to the cause, [check out Laura's fundraising page](http://www.the3day.org/Seattle07/lauramackenzie) where you can find out more info and/or sign up to donate whatever amount of money you feel comfortable with...
