title: Yay Vegetables!

Having finished my first week in the 20/20 weight loss program, and having lost 5lbs (or 2.7% of my weight, to put it in more relative terms), they've graciously allowed me to add veggies back in. Not too much of course, but a couple of cups of lettuce go a long ways towards making a chicken breast seem like a real meal.
