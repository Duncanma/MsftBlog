Yesterday [I posted about the use of the feed icon](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2006/01/16/3548.aspx) on [Media Center Sandbox](http://blog.mediacentersandbox.com/) and suggested a few changes. Last night, I get an email from [Charlie Owen](http://blog.retrosight.com/), one of the principals of the sandbox site, and the site is completely updated. Now, I don't know if I caused any change or if the change was just in the works anyway.... but regardless, I like the new look and the [icons](http://www.feedicons.com) look great!
