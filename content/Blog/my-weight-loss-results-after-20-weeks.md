title: My weight loss results after 20 weeks
type: posts
---
In September of last year I signed up for [the 20/20 program at the Pro Club](http://www.proclub.com/Home/MedicalWellness/2020Lifestyles/tabid/488/Default.aspx), a 25 week weight-loss program that includes personal training, dietitian appointments and even group therapy (yay!). Well, I'm pretty much wrapped up on the program, and a few weeks ago they had me in to take measurements and a photo... they took a photo at the beginning as well, so we end up with the classic before and after comparision.

Overall I lost 30 pounds, but that is only one number... I dropped six inches around my waist (so none of my pants fit), my bad cholesterol went down, my good cholesterol went up... blood pressure dropped... nothing but good stuff.

I'll be posting some other details over time, about the program and about what I'm doing now for exercise and diet, but if you're interested in specific details about anything, just post a comment to let me know.
