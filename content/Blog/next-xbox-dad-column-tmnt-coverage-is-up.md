My 2nd column is up on Xbox.com, [covering the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/xboxdad/20070426-tmnt.htm).

[<img src="http://www.xbox.com/NR/rdonlyres/385CE949-3650-4A5C-A9FF-92114B0606A6/0/ilmTMNT_nextgen_09.jpg" border="0" />](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/xboxdad/20070426-tmnt.htm)

To sum up, it is a pretty fun game for kids; I'd compare it to a faster paced, less scary and complex version of Prince of Persia, which is a great game to be compared to.
