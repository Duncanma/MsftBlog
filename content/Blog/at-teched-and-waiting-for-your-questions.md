Headed over to registration today, very very busy... then to the Cabana with [Erik Porter](http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/archive/2004/05/23/139838.aspx)... very very empty.... Erik and I then decided to head off to catch a pre-conference session, but even those were backed up due to the long registration lines. Oh well, back to the Cabana to wait for some great VB questions ðŸ™‚
