title: Still 2 to go for the flat screen :)
type: posts

Sign-ups seem to have plateaued, [I posted that I had 2 left](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/02/16/1116.aspx) for [the free flat screen site](http://www.freeflatscreens.com/?r=13882371) on February 16th, and I'm still at the same point. What I do have though, is about 15 "yellows" which means a person signed up but never completed an offer... everyone starts out yellow before going to "green" and becoming a valid referral counting towards the number you need, so all those yellows can lead to a false sense of accomplishment :). If anyone is interested in signing up, I strongly recommend [the zooba.com offer](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/02/25/1149.aspx), it is easy and seems to be a pretty good deal.
