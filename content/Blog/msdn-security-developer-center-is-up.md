Yet another Developer Center has been launched, this one is all about Security and is being run by one of my colleagues; Brian Johnson... check it out at <http://msdn.microsoft.com/security>

**Welcome to the Security Developer Center**
  
  
As a leader in the software industry, Microsoft recognizes its responsibility to develop technology and programming interfaces that allow application developers to create secure applications. The MSDN Security Developer Center is a direct result of the focus that Microsoft has put on security and trustworthy computing.
