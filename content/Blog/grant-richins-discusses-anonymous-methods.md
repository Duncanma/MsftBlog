title: Grant Richins discusses Anonymous Methods
type: posts
---
[Grant](http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/) starts on what appears to be a series of posts about a new C# language feature, with ["Anonymous Methods, Part 1 of ?"](http://blogs.msdn.com/grantri/archive/2004/02/05/68526.aspx)

> _So what are anonymous methods? It is a way of writing an unnamed nested method that, just like most languages that have nested methods, allows access to all of the outer method's locals and parameters, including the 'this' parameter._
