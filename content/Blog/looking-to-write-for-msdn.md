title: Looking to write for MSDN?
type: posts
---
Someone recently asked me for our template, style guidelines and other details about writing for MSDN. I wanted to find the public page about this, so I dug around for what seemed like ages and **couldn't find anything** even though I knew this was up on MSDN somewhere.

Eventually, I resorted to search and tracked it down at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/aboutmsdn/submit.asp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/aboutmsdn/submit.asp). Since it was so hard for me to find, I thought I should bubble it up to the front page of VB and C#, in case anyone else is looking for it ðŸ™‚

**Update:** Stephen Toub from MSDN Magazine just sent me the corresponding link for submissions to their publication... [http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/submit.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/submit.aspxAnother)

**Another Update:** For some reason, this posts gets a lot of comments from people looking for a free download of MSDN. That is not what this post is about, it is about **writing articles** for MSDN. Go ahead and ask for a free copy of MSDN, I'm just going to ignore it.... that isn't something I can provide.
