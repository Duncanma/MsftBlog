The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) is pleased to announce the launch of the [Azure DevOps Bounty](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-azure-devops) program, a program dedicated to providing rock-solid security for our DevOps customers. Starting January 17, 2019, we’re excited to offer rewards up to US\$20,000 for eligible vulnerabilities in Azure DevOps online services and the latest release of Azure DevOps server.

[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) is a cloud service for collaborating on code development, spanning the breadth of the development lifecycle to help developers ship software faster and with higher quality.

The researcher community plays an essential role in keeping our customers secure, and we will review every submission and recognize your efforts according to our program criteria. If your submission isn’t eligible for bounty but still helps us fix or improve our product, we’ll offer public [thanks and recognition](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/researcher-acknowledgments-online-services) for your contribution. Please submit your vulnerabilities to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).
