The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) works with partners all over the world to protect Microsoft customers. This week we’re headed to the Philippines to meet security researchers and bounty hunters at [**ROOTCON 13!**](https://www.rootcon.org/home)

Planning on attending ROOTCON? If you want to learn more about how you can earn rewards for reporting vulnerabilities to Microsoft bounty programs, you have two ways to connect with us there:

**Come see our talk on authentication failures. **MSRC Security Engineering Lead **Vishal Chauhan **presents "[**Identity crisis: war stories from authentication failures**](https://www.rootcon.org/html/rc13/talks#identity_crisis_auth_failure)" on Thursday. Vishal will share details about previously reported authentication vulnerabilities we’ve fixed and what we learned from them, including examples which you can apply to your own vulnerability hunting efforts.

**Date & Time: **Thursday 26 September 2019: Main track @ 3:45 – 4:30 pm

**Join us for a reception to learn more about the range of Microsoft’s bounty programs. **Join members of the MSRC team for an evening of drinks, snacks and a short panel discussion about bounty hunting, including the [**Microsoft Identity Bounty**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-microsoft-identity). Please note: the party is free to attend, but space is limited to 100, [**so register today!**](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR8-HsvI7yoBKlBWYsQ84uNJUMDRGNFFKQ1lRWVE1WkhCRkU0SzRPWU1SVS4u) Have a question you'd like to ask?
