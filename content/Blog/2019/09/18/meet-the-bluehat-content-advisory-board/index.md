We couldn’t do BlueHat without the Content Advisory Board, the brain trust reviewing submissions to the CFP. Representing both Microsoft and other parts of security community, the CAB applies their industry and speaker experience to create the BlueHat agenda that’s the right mix of topics and perspectives. We really appreciate the time these people take to review every submission and find the right talks.
