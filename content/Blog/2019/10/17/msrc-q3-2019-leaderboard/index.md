Right before Black Hat USA 2019, we [announced our new researcher recognition program](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/30/recognizing-security-researchers-in-2019/), and at Black Hat we [announced the top researchers from the previous twelve months](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/). Since it’s easier to track your progress with regular updates than with just an annual report, we are excited to announce the MSRC Q3 2019 Security Researcher Leaderboard, which shows the current standings for each quarter. The leaderboard rankings are determined by the total [points](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program) each researcher earned during the program period while participating in the [MSRC Researcher Recognition Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program).

Challenging yourself to be on the board for the 2020 [MSRC Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/)? Keep in mind that in addition to the total points, we also take multiple factors into consideration while identifying the top tier researchers. Check out the [program page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program) for full details on how to use multipliers and high-value targets to maximize the points you get for each case.
