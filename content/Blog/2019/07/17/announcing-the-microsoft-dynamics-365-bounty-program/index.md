One of Microsoft’s many security investments to protect customers is in the partnerships we build with the external security research community. We are excited to announce the launch of the[ Dynamics 365 Bounty program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dynamics) and welcome researchers to seek out and disclose any high impact vulnerabilities they may find in Dynamics 365. Rewards up to US\$20,000 are available for eligible vulnerabilities in both Dynamics 365 online services and the latest release of Dynamics 365 on-premises.

With the launch of the Dynamics 365 bounty we’ve also updated the main [Microsoft Bounty Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty?rtc=1) page. We’ve simplified the high-level requirements for all our programs, added additional links and resources, and grouped our programs into three categories:

- **Cloud \*\***Programs\*\*, like Azure DevOps and Dynamics 365
- **Platform \*\***Programs\*\*, like Windows Insider Preview and Hyper-V
- **Defense Programs**, like the Mitigation Bypass and Bounty for Defense

Microsoft is committed to strengthening our partnership with the security research community, and I look forward to sharing more bounty updates and improvements in the coming months.

Happy Hacking!
