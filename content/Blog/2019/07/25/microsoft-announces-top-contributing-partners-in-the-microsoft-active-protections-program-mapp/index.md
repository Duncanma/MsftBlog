Today we announce the top organizational candidates for Vulnerability Top Contributors, Threat Indicator Top Submitters, and Zero-Day Top Reporting for the period of July 1, 2018 â€“ June 30, 2019.

The [Microsoft Active Protections Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/mapp) provides security and protection to customers through cooperation and collaboration with industry leading partners. This bi-directional sharing program of threat and vulnerability data has proven instrumental to help prevent broad attacks and quickly resolve security vulnerabilities in Microsoft products and services.

Each of these partners made a significant impact on the security ecosystem and are commended for their customer-first approach to security. We will announce the top three contributors in each category during a special reception for these partners at the Black Hat Conference on August 8, 2019.
