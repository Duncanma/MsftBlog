The MSRC is more than managing vulnerability reports, publishing Microsoft security updates, and defending the cloud. The MSRC is passionate about helping everyone improve internal engineering practices and supporting the defender community, and are excited to partner with Blackberry to host a Product Security Operations Forum at [LocoMocoSec](https://locomocosec.com/) on April 18, 2019.

Featuring exceptional speakers from across the industry, the Product Security Operations Forum will share what industry practitioners have learned about problems (and solutions!) of secure development and managing vulnerability response. We’ll have hands-on practitioners from, npm, Adobe, Microsoft, GitHub, and elsewhere discussing the operational programs and processes they are using to tackle real-world challenges. Since no single person has all the answers, we also hope that everyone attending will take advantage of the event format to meet and share knowledge with each other about the approaches they’ve taken—and then continue the conversation at the luau event in the evening.

And if that’s not enough, LocoMocoSec has loads of other great content and workshops scheduled. Interested? The conference schedule is [online](https://locomocosec2019.sched.com/) and the advance purchase discount deadline is March 26.

We look forward to seeing you there!

Senior Security Program Manager
