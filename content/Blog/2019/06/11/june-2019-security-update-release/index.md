Today, we released security updates to provide additional protections against malicious attackers. As a best practice, we encourage customers to [turn on automatic updates](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/306525/how-to-configure-and-use-automatic-updates-in-windows).

More information about this monthâ€™s security updates can be found on the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/).
