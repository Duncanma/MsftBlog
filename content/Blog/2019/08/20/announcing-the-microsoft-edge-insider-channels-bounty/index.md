This week, we released the first Beta preview of the next version of [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/?form=MO12G0&OCID=MO12G0). Alongside this, Microsoft is excited to announce the launch of the [Microsoft Edge Insider Bounty Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-new-edge?rtc=1). We welcome researchers to seek out and disclose any high impact vulnerabilities they may find in the next version of Microsoft Edge, based on Chromium, and offer rewards up to **US\$30,000** for eligible vulnerabilities in Dev and Beta channels.

<!-- wp:list -->

- We aim to complement the [Chrome Vulnerability Reward Program](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/chrome-rewards/), so any report that reproduces on the latest version of Microsoft Edge but not Chrome will be reviewed for bounty eligibility based on severity, impact, and report quality.
- Valid reports affecting the next version of Microsoft Edge will receive a 2X bonus multiplier in the [Researcher Recognition Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program).
- Faster rewards: the new Microsoft Edge bounty program will provide bounty will award upon completion of reproduction and assessment of each submission.

The new bounty program will run alongside the existing [Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) on Windows Insider Preview](https://microsoft.com/msrc/bounty-edge) bounty program. Vulnerabilities that reproduce in the latest, fully patched version of Windows (including Windows 10, Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1) or MacOS may be eligible for the Microsoft Edge Insider bounty program. Windows Insider Preview is not required.
