There are many dedicated people and organizations who contribute to the protection and security of our common customers. For years, Microsoft has recognized security researchers for helping protect the ecosystem. Now, weâ€™re announcing the launch of a new program to better recognize and thank Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) partners for all they do to protect our customers, including awards and evangelism based on their contributions.

MAPP provides better protections for customers through:

- Early access to monthly security release information, allowing partners to proactively apply protections prior to the release date
- Sharing of threat indicators
- Reporting vulnerabilities in Microsoft products and following Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

In the last six months, MAPP partners have provided 430 unique vulnerability reports and submitted nearly 158 million threat indicators. This data helps Microsoft harden the ecosystem and better protect customers. Many of our partners work closely with us, providing information and samples for critical incidents allowing us to release security updates prior to any broad exploitation.

Starting July 1, 2019, Microsoft will publicly recognize the great work being done by these partners and the significant contributions they make to securing customers. All partners will receive a perpetual plaque in recognition of their MAPP team membership. Then, each quarter, partners have an opportunity to receive a bronze, silver, or gold tab to attach their plaque based on their contribution to program objectives, including submitting threat indicators, reporting vulnerabilities, and practicing CVD. During the annual Black Hat USA conference, we will also offer special recognition the top ten contributors in the MAPP program.

In addition to this new recognition program, we will use our social media presence to publicly evangelize these partners. A list of all MAPP partners can be found at <https://aka.ms/mapp>.

Thank you to all our MAPP partners for all you do to help protect our customers and secure the broader ecosystem.
