title: Not quite ready for prime-time
type: posts
---
I have a lot of code hanging around, and the techniques in that code would likely help people who are getting started with .NET, but I haven't had to time to "polish" it up for public release... 

I'm starting to wonder, with the rapid pace of technology, if I should just release things as they are and tweak later if I have time... at least they will provide some benefit to some people. If I wait until I get around to tidying them up, the need for these samples might be less... hmm... I just hate posting code that I've never polished, it is like having company over without cleaning up. Thoughts?
