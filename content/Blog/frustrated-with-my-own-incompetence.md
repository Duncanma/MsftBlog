title: Frustrated with my own incompetence...
type: posts

I've been rebuilding my site to use master pages (which is done and works great!) and along the way I decide to get rid of the tables used to create my top and side menu areas, moving instead to a CSS model...

No idea why, but I can't get it to do what I want!! I've created a CSS based right off of a sample that is baked into Dreamweaver, and then tried to wrap the right styles around my content, but the main area of my page is appearing below the side menu, not floating alongside... bah. Anyway, I've put a test file up [here](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/test.htm) and it is using [this CSS file](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/main.css)... so if anyone is a bit more of a CSS expert than me (and that wouldn't be hard), I'd love some suggestions....
