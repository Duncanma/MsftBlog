title: Fable is addicting...

Yesterday I started up my first [Fable](http://www.xbox.com/fable) game, 3 hours of my life lost already. Lots of fun though.

Tonight wasn't as much fun; I tried 3 times to play and each time I was stopped with a dirty disc error... not sure why that is, but after 3 times I figured it was a divine hint to get back to work ðŸ™‚
