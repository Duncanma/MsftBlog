Follow the link to get a high-quality WMV for your PC, a WMV for your Zune or a MP4 for your iPod/PSP... or a WMA/MP3 if all you want is the music ðŸ™‚

[Heck, I even have an Ogg Vorbis version up there](http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/D/5/5D5E2663-F209-4433-B873-F3FA2176EAC0/GetYourXboxOn.ogg).

_And yes, we know that Laura was known to bash MSFT a bit (ok, a lot...) when she was at G4... the irony is not lost on us ðŸ™‚_
