title: Eric J. Smith's CodeSmith Utility
type: posts

I use this program all the time, but I paved my machine recently and didn't have it installed... It took me awhile to figure out [the web site](http://www.ericjsmith.net/codesmith/) for the tool, so I thought I would post it for everyone's enjoyment!

For those that haven't had the pleasure of using this utility, here is a quick description:

> CodeSmith is a FREEWARE template-based code generator that can generate code for any ASCII-based language. CodeSmith templates use a syntax nearly identical to ASP.NET syntax so that creating templates should feel immediately familiar to ASP.NET developers.
