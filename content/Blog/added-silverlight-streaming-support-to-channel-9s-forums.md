Continuing on in the same pattern as my last post, [adding Soapbox support to C9's forums](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/blog/added-support-for-soapbox-videos-on-channel-9/), [Adam Kinney](http://www.adamkinney.com) bugged me a bit and I went ahead and added support for [Silverlight Streaming](http://blogs.msdn.com/cheller/archive/2007/07/30/silverlight-streaming-new-iframe-based-invocation-mechanism.aspx) as well.

It will be interesting to see if (or more accurately, how long before) someone turns this to malicious purposes.
