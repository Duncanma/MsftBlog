title: Anyone have contacts with TVTonic?
type: posts
---
One of their users emailed us to comment on our video quality... essentially pointing out that it sucked when viewed through their TV using TV Tonic. Well I was puzzled because, while we don't ship out DVD quality video, our high quality download is quite good for a podcast. Turns out though, after installing TV Tonic and picking on10.net out of their catalog, that the feed they have in their system is our 512kbps WMV feed... which is certainly not the best quality around, around 430kbps for video and 320&#215;240... fine for display on our site, but not the hottest around... instead [they should be using our WMV (high quality) feed](http://on10.net/feeds/rss/wmvhigh/) (2500 kbps, 640 x 480), but I have no idea how to tell them about it. I've emailed their support address, but didn't ever hear back from them....
