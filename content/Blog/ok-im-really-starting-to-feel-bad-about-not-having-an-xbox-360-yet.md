title: Ok, I'm really starting to feel bad about not having an Xbox 360 yet...
type: posts

[My book is about to come out](http://www.xbox4dummies.com" title="Xbox 360 for Dummies) (don't worry, I had a 360 to use while writing the book... so my lack of one now does not reduce the accuracy of the book ðŸ™‚ ), and I work at a place with probably one of the world's highest concentration of Xbox 360 fans .... and I don't have one yet. I pre-ordered from EB Games, but I didn't pre-order quite soon enough I guess (October), so they haven't gotten down to me yet. In fact, they aren't even working on the same page of the list yet... ugh.
