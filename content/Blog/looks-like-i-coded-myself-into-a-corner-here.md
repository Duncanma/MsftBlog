This is the sort of thing that happens with large development teams, one team codes in 'fixes' that break someone else's work... I don't normally do this all by myself! I [updated the Flairmaker to support Atom 0.3](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/10/23/3112.aspx), then I [updated my feeds to Atom 1.0](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/11/01/3183.aspx) ... great.

[See the error, laugh at the coder... or will it be fixed by the time you click this?](http://eris1109.si-xios.info/FlairMaker.ashx?atom=http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/atom.aspx)
