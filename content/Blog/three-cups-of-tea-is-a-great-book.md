In the language of the snarky internet, "This aged well", by which I mean it didn't. I really enjoyed this book, but fairly long after I read it, [questions about its honesty came out](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Cups-Deceit-Humanitarian-ebook/dp/B004XHVOW4). While many people have pointed out that the values and message of the original book were still valid, you should definitely be aware that it may be more of a story than a true accounting.

One positive side to being stuck at home for two weeks is that I was able to do a fair bit more reading. For the most part, I read magazines and watched movies, but my wife also brought me the book 'Three Cups of Tea' about Greg Mortenson's work in Pakistan building schools for the children of poor rural areas. Mr. Mortenson, an avid mountain climber, ended up spending time in a small village near the base of K2 in Pakistan, barely making it down alive after a failed attempt to reach the summit. Spending time with those people made quite an affect on him and from that point on he was on a mission to build schools and otherwise help out the people of that area. The book is great reading, dealing with exciting events, perilous adventures and important issues ... all taking place in an area of the world that is completely foreign to many of us. Check it out, read more reviews or buy it here ['Three Cups of Tea' in paperback from amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143038257?tag=duncanmackenz-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0143038257&adid=0V4A0CSRV4GS0GNJ1VY6&).
