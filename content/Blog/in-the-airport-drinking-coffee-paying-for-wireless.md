On my way, and I'm realizing that I have a bit of preperation to do... this whole trip has been so last minute, and I've been focused on building the web site that will appear at http://msdn.microsoft.com/pdc tomorrow, that I haven't even looked at the conference schedule. To be honest, I'm only barely aware of what hotel I'm even staying at... I guess tonight is the night to regroup and make some plans for the week. I hope I can meet up with a ton of folks while I'm down there... just email if you are trying to track me down.
