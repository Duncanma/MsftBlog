Ok, so I am so going to do [this for taking pictures of my kids](http://shootingthekids.dpblogs.com/2006/06/27/make-your-photo-subjects-laugh/)... but wait... I could probably do this on top of the video camera for Channel 9 shoots too! Now if I can only get my son's collection of Star Wars Pez Dispensers away from him and put them under the knife.
