title: A public site for collecting your exception info... like Dr. Watson via SOAP...
type: posts

This is an interesting idea ... [http://www.exceptioncollection.com/](http://www.exceptioncollection.com/), something that I've [pondered before.](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/03/08/1212.aspx)..

I'd have to know more about it, in terms of the privacy and security of their data collection... before I could recommend it without any pause, but I would certainly take a look if you are building a widely distributed application (outside of a single company/enterprise), and I would probably try to integrate with the Exception handling/logging block from PAG.
