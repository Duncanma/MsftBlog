    <b> [Chats on Visual Basic 2005](http://blogs.msdn.com/vbteam/archive/2004/07/07/175635.aspx) </b> _ For the past year, I've been organizing the Visual Basic chats that appear at _ [ _http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats/_ ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats/) _. For the most part, these chats focused on answering your questions about Visual Basic._



    _Naturally, now that the Beta 1 for Visual Basic 2005 is available, I wanted to schedule some chats to answer your Beta questions. But after discussing this with Robert Green, we decided to change the format somewhat; instead of just answering questions, the chat hosts will also be looking for feedback about what you like (or don't like) about the selected feature...._
