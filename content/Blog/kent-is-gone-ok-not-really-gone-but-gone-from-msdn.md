type: posts

It is a sad day for MSDN and Microsoft, [Kent Sharkey](http://www.acmebinary.com/blogs/kent) (ASP.NET & Coding4Fun content strategist, coder of many of the coolest things on MSDN and the guy to whom I send entire projects full of not quite working code with the message "help!?!?") has left to become an independent consultant type guy... Expect MSDN to get a bit duller as of this moment ðŸ™‚
