A friend of mine has written [this google gadget](http://leancode.com/2007/01/26/feedsparks-101/) in true mashup style... it uses an API from Feedburner, a service to produce the graphics, and works async to update itself right in the browser ... and produces a sweet little graphic about your current # of subscribers.
