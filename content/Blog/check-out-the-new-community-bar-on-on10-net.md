title: Check out the new Community Bar on on10.net
type: posts
---
One of my jobs over the past couple of weeks has been to build a javascript based 'toolbar' that could run across the top of on10.net and show folks headlines aggregated from a variety of Microsoft Community sites. So, along with a bunch of help from [Adam](http://www.adamkinney.com) and [Erik](http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/), I managed to get it finished and deployed today. [You can see it on top of the page on 10](http://on10.net)

If it overlaps with the logo for you, try forcing a refresh using ctrl+f5 in IE... or just picking reload/refresh in whatever browser you use... the css had to change to accommodate this new content and the old css often sticks in the cache longer than it should.
