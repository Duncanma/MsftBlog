[Jan Gray](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/jangr) [talks about](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/jangr/permalink.aspx/114cc4bd-34b3-4082-8e5e-d3a0e4aed8ce) the update to the CLR Profiler

We've just updated [the CLRProfiler distribution](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=86CE6052-D7F4-4AEB-9B7A-94635BEEBDDA&#038;displaylang=en). Once again, we're shipping both the source and the prebuilt binaries, and this time we're delighted to include a terrific ~100 page tutorial and reference manual written by the tool's author, Peter Sollich.

I think this new documentation greatly enhances the power and utility of the profiler by demonstrating how to use its features more effectively â€“ for example, how to diagnose a memory leak. </ul>

Definitely a tool you want to get, I know the early version rocked, so this must be even better ðŸ™‚
