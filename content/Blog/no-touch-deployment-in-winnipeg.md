title: No Touch Deployment in Winnipeg
type: posts
---
I'm on my way to Winnipeg, Manitoba to give a talk on No Touch Deployment with .NET; luckily I managed to find wireless access at the Vancouver airport along the way. If I had to pick one thing about .NET that justifies a move from VB6 windows applications to VB.NET Windows Forms it would have to be the ease of deployment and update using the Internet. Check out this article for more info on the whole concept of [No Touch Deployment](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/building/windows/deploy/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/vbtchno-touchdeploymentinnetframework.asp) or just check out the whole [Windows Forms deployment area](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/building/windows/deploy/default.aspx) of the [VB Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic) on MSDN.
