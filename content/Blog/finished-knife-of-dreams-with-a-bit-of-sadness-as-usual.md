title: Finished "Knife of Dreams", with a bit of sadness as usual
type: posts

Don't misunderstand, I enjoyed [the book](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/10/26/3118.aspx)... but just like watching an episode of your favorite TV show and knowing that it will be another week until you can see another (or watching the Pegasus episode of Battlestar Galactica, knowing that it will be **months** before you see the conclusion of that story), I'm always sad to see it end.[<img alt="Link to info about the book Knife of Time" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0312873077.01._AA_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" align="left" border="0" />](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0312873077&link_code=as2&camp=1789&tag=duncanmackenz-20&creative=9325)

I put off reading the book at all for quite some time, figuring that once I started I would neglect other responsibilities (including some sleep) until it was done, and I also thought that it would be good to go back and re-read #10, so that the story flowed better for me. I didn't end up re-reading the previous book, that would have taken way too long, but the reduction in sleep as I read the book was certainly the case.
