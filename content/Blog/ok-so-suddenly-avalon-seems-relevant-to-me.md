With [the recent annoucements](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/Aug04/08-27Target2006PR.asp), I get to check something off of my personal wishlist.... Avalon (and some connected systems thing... "purple" I think it's called...) will be available on WinXP!!

I mean, Longhorn seems cool and all... but I just wasn't all that interested in a UI technology that wouldn't run on anything but the very latest OS, especially considering the very wide deployment of XP that will exist by the time Longhorn ships. I've often thought though, that if they made it run on XP, then I'd be interested, and I guess I wasn't the only person hoping for that!

From [the press release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/Aug04/08-27Target2006PR.asp);

> _At a meeting today with several hundred of the company&rsquo;s top developer evangelists from around the world, Microsoft also announced that the Windows WinFX developer technologies, including the new presentation subsystem code-named "Avalon" and the new communication subsystem code-named Indigo, will be made available for Microsoft&reg; Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 in 2006. This availability will expand the scope of opportunity for developers by enabling them to write applications that can run on hundreds of millions of PCs, resulting in enhanced experiences for users of those operating systems._
