Ok, so if I was dealing with a 360, I could just pick up the VGA output cable... but for some reason, we never made one of those for the original Xbox. Now, I've found [some companies that make reasonably priced converters from component video inputs to VGA](http://www.x2vga.com/) (I've found several in the unreasonable price range too) but either they are permantely out of stock... or [they](http://www.ddrgame.com/xbox1.html) look a little ... hmm... how to say this, not like someone I'd like to give my credit card to?

Anyone else doing this? What are you using?
