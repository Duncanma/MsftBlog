title: Firmware Update results in a Bricked PSP
type: posts
---
I&rsquo;m at my nephew&rsquo;s place for a bit and he just &lsquo;bricked&rsquo; his PSP. He put in a game and it started to do a firmware update... he didn&rsquo;t understand what it was doing and was worried it was going to mess up his PSP, so he turned the power off.

Now, it won&rsquo;t even power up. I&rsquo;m thinking we are screwed at this point... unless I can find some solution on the Internet... but I'm going to head down to the local Sony store tomorrow to see what they have to say. I find it hard to believe that the PSP is so fragile that a nine year old can completely render it unusable by just pressing the power button at the wrong time.
