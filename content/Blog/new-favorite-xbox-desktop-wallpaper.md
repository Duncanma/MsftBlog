I went over to 360Style.net today to find that it has been totally redesigned... same great content, much easier to find your way around. While I was there I picked up [a new background for my Vista box](http://www.360style.net/wallpapers28.html). The wallpapers that ship with Vista are beautiful, but they can't compare with this...
