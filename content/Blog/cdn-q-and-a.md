description: Various questions on CDNs and my attempts to answer them
---
There are many common questions that come up [when talking about CDNs]({{< relref "overview-of-cdn.md" >}}), and I thought I would address them here on the site one at a time. Happy to add more if I haven't addressed something you think needs to be added (just [@ me on twitter](https://twitter.com/duncanma)).

* [Should you have a separate domain for CDN served content?]({{< relref "cdn-separate-domain.md" >}})
* [How does Purging content work with a CDN?]({{< relref "cdn-purge-and-invalidate.md" >}})
* [Are CDNs only for caching and distributing content?]({{< relref "cdn-advanced-functionality.md" >}})
* [Pushing content to the CDN?](({{< relref "cdn-push-vs-pull.md" >}})
