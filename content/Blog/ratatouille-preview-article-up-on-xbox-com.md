[My latest kid-focused game article, which happens to be yet another movie tie-in, is about the upcoming Pixar film Ratatouille](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/personality/xboxdad/2007/0620-ratatouille.htm). Cool game, very nice looking... and it has entire missions around making recipes by spilling ingredients... just like how I cook at home!
