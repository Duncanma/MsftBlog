I was just browsing the chats page at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats](http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats) (boy, if ever a page was in need of an RSS feed, this would be it) and I noticed some really cool upcoming chats;

  * Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) on January 14, 2004 at 10am PST
  * The Essentials for Programming in Visual Basic .NET on November 14, 2003 at 1pm PST, and
  * Changes for Visual C# in Whidbey on November 20th at 2pm PST

Although there is no feed, they do have convenient links to add these items to your Calendar tool (maybe just Outlook? they are .vcs files... seems like they should work in more places...)
