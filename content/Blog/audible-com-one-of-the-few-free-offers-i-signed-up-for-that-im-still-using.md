title: Audible.com, one of the few free offers I signed up for that I'm still using...

Along with [Zooba.com](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/02/25/1149.aspx), I've kept my Audible membership as well... (and Columbia House DVD and BMG Music ... oh, and Vonage... [ok, there are quite a few free offers that I ended up keeping!!](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/04/27/1400.aspx)). Audible is pretty handy for those of us who have the occasional long driving trip, I burned '[Getting things done](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/duncanmackenz-20?creative=327641&#038;camp=14573&#038;link_code=as1)' onto CD along with '[Accidental Buddhist](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385492677/duncanmackenz-20?creative=327641&#038;camp=14573&#038;link_code=as1)' (3 CDs apiece) and it really made the time fly driving to and from my Mother's house up in BC... never listened to anything in the car though, and while I take a few podcasts to the gym sometimes I've never tried taking anything from Audible. Still, it has turned out to be pretty useful. They are running a deal now where you can get a free trial if you sign up through [this link](http://www.audible.com/tellAFriend/525878FTZ22J), so if you are interested you can probably get a couple of downloads to check out before committing to anything long term.
