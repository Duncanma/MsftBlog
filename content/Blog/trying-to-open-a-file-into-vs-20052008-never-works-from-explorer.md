title: Trying to open a file into VS 2005/2008 ... never works from Explorer
type: posts
---
So I have a file on disk, web.config in this case, and I right click and pick 'open with | Visual Studio 2008' ... and I get this:



Windows cannot find 'C:\projects\9\web.config'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.

[OK]



VS 2008 opens, but no file. If I then pick the file from File | Open it works fine... what the hell? As far as I can remember, this was true with VS 2005 and it has annoyed me every day...
