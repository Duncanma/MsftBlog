title: Getting back into programming after a few years at home with the kids...
type: posts
---
A friend of mine, through my wife, has been a stay-at-home mom for the past few years and is trying to get back into the swing of computer programming. It doesn't take long to get out of date in the computer industry, so I can understand her desire to flex her _coding muscles_ a bit. Although she could just go back to what she knew before, she has decided to try learning something that is completely new, which I think is a great way to go. Personally I might have suggested C# to someone with her background (C, C++, Assembly), but perhaps I'm biased ðŸ™‚ ... and I have to admit that her decision to go with Ruby seems pretty cool.

You can visit her blog, [Confessions of a Ruby Newbie](http://rubynewbie.blogspot.com/), to follow along with her progress as she gets back into programming and explores Ruby at the same time. If you happen to have gone through a similar experience, getting back into your field after staying at home, I'm sure she'd love to know how it went for you!
