If you've written an app, private or public, using [my data feed of Xbox live info](http://duncanmackenzie.net/blog/put-up-a-rest-api-for-xbox-gamertag-data/default.aspx) I'd really appreciate it if you'd let me know. This isn't a required 'sign-up', but I want to start to keep track so that I could possibly create a page listing all the sites using it, and it may also be useful to be able to contact folks if I need to make a change or take the service down for an hour or so. Just comment on this post, or drop me a line at <duncanma@microsoft.com>.
