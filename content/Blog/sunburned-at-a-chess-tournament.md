Well, this certainly isn't something that happens all that often, but after spending all day at [a chess tournament](http://www.chess4life.com/chess-event/Wellington-Spring-Chess-Tournament/191) (at Wellington Elementary in Woodinville) on Saturday, I ended up with a sunburn on my face and arms! It turned out to be a really nice day, which was good, since the waiting area for parents and kids (where the parents spend up about 6 to 7 hours, and the kids spend all the time between matches) was **outside**. Never seen that before, and it was cold and wet enough when we arrived that I was pretty unimpressed with the idea. In the end though, it was very sunny out there ... and it certainly gave Connor a lot of fresh air between his matches (which were inside the school gym).
