While I was there, I noticed they are running another contest as well, [for an Alienware PC](http://jade.bioware.com/pc/), tied to the release of Jade Empire for the PC. And, while we are on the subject of BioWare, we might as well mention [Mass Effect (Big BioWare RPG for the Xbox 360)](http://masseffect.bioware.com/)!!
