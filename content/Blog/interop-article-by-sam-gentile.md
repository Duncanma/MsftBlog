[Sam "blogger guy" Gentile](http://samgentile.com/blog) has a new article up on MSDN: [Beyond (COM) Add Reference: Has Anyone Seen the Bridge?](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/bridge.asp)

**Summary** Sam Gentile explains the need for bridges between COM Interop and the Microsoft .NET Framework, and how bridges are implemented in the .NET Framework.

Interop is such a major part of .NET coding these days so this should be a useful article!
