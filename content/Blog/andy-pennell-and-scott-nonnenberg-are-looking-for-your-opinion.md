I say 'most' because the Output window lives on the View menu, under Other Windows sub-menu.



    Where do you expect debugger windows to be on the menu? (Ignore Output for now, we intend to fix that one independent of this). Your choices are:


  <ol>
    <li>
      Where they have been since 7.0 (ie under Debug/Windows) <li>
        Where every other window is (ie under View/Debugger Windows)?
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>


    We can't agree, so need the communities feedback.
