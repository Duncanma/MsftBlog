As someone who works on [a video based Microsoft site](http://on10.net), you'd think I would have already found this... but I had no idea it was out... description from the site itself:

> **What it is**
>
> A user uploaded video service where you can upload, watch and share videos with people around the world.
> **Here are some of the cool things you can do with Soapbox on MSN Video: ****
>** 1. Easily upload videos in almost any format—like from your video or digital camera
> 2. Tag and categorize your videos to make it easy for other people to find them
> 3. Watch original videos and browse for new ones at the same time
> 4. Set up your own personal RSS feeds for videos you’re interested in
