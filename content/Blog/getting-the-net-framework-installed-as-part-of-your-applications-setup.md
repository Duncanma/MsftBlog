title: Getting the .NET Framework Installed as part of your application's setup
type: posts

I'm working on the bootstrapper chapter for my upcoming ClickOnce book and it occured to me that a lot of people probably haven't heard about the bootstrapper for Visual Studio .NET 2003...

> **[Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/tools/bootstrapper/)**

> The Visual Studio .NET Framework Bootstrapper Plug-in modifies the behavior of the Setup project's Bootstrapper property to include the .NET Framework bootstrapper as well as the Windows Installer bootstrapper.

Got a .NET app? Need to get the Framework onto the user's machine? Check out the bootstrapper!!
