title: Matt Warren on Language Design
type: posts

[Matt](http://blogs.msdn.com/mattwar) provides us with some insights into the world of language design, a field that most of us have only dabbled in via a university course, with his discussion of keywords, operators and the problems with extending an existing programming language after its original release.

> _It amazes me how difficult it is to design new features to a programming language. Once a language is baked in its original form itâ€™s almost impossible to add new semantics let alone syntax rules. Operators are hellish. You want to invent new ones, but you are generally limited to the common symbols found on the standard keyboard._
