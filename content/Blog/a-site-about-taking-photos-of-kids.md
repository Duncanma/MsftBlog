title: A site about taking photos of kids...
type: posts

But with a really cool name: <http://shootingthekids.dpblogs.com>

This site is definitely my latest happy discovery on the old series of pipes we call the Internet. As someone who takes lots of photos and almost every one of them ends up being one of my kids... this site is perfect.
