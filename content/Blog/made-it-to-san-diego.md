title: Made it to San Diego...

I flew down to TechEd today, and I made it to the Marriott without any incidents... and I have my first 'Cabana' session tomorrow at 8:30 am... This means I'll be hanging out in the convention center, in the 'Cabana' area, in case anyone wants to drop by and chat about VB... there will be someone there for all the major technology areas pretty much all the time throughout the week. I've got quite a few shifts scheduled, which means that the Cabanas will be the best place to find me at almost anytime during the event...

Internet works fine in the hotel rooms by the way, it is a bit slow but the front desk told me (and other folks checking in at the same time) that it wasn't working... for all I know it will stop at any moment, but I would suggest just trying it out anyway, even if the hotel staff tell you that you would be better off sticking to dial-up for now.
