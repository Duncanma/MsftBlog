title: Hit the fountain and fair at Seattle Center this weekend with the kids

Good times were had by all, although mostly by my son (Connor)!

Played in the fountain, ate some hotdogs and did a few rides (very few) at the fair that sits below the Space Needle (you can see the needle in the back of this shot).

My high-point of the trip? When my son looked over a perfect stranger in line (a guy, probably around my age... no kids with him) and asked for a bite of his cotton candy. Well, after a look at me to make sure it was ok, the dude pulled the plastic bag off the top of his cotton candy so that Connor could grab a previously untouched piece and Connor got his first taste of pure sugar in stringy/fluffy form.

Now, I don't want my son to be all weird about strangers but I did mention to him later that asking strangers for candy is not normally a good idea... although I'm less concerned about folks that he **asks** for candy, compared to someone who offers ðŸ™‚
