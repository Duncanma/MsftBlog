title: I am definitely going to need more HD inputs on my TV

I have been drooling over [this](http://www.rokulabs.com/) for that last few weeks...

> _**inner monologue:** it doesn't do anything that I really need, and if I ever get around to hooking my [current music system](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/musicxp) up with something better than S-Video, I could probably replicate its functionality in a pretty short period of time...._

but, it sure looks cool, and that has added it to an overly long list of 'things I would buy if I had the $$ to order them and the time to use them'.

It seems like a slightly more efficient idea to pay the $120 for [a VGA-Component adapter](http://www.smarthome.com/77706.html) for my music system (so that it displays at 720 progressive, instead of 480 interlaced) and then build photo-viewing/slideshow support into it, but gadget-love isn't about efficiency.

We (the content strategist team at MSDN) are heading down to Fry's en masse on Tuesday, which should be a wonderful display of technology lust and perhaps even acquisition (although not by me, I've sated my gadget lust for a few months with that [DVI-equipped DVD player](http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&prod_id=DVD-HD931%2fXAA))... yup, should be a fun time for all.
