Snippets are a pretty cool feature of VS 2005.... aka Intellitasks to some... and Gus has created a tool to make them... (well, he did back in March.... :))

    <b> <a id="viewpost.ascx_TitleUrl" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gusperez/archive/2004/03/21/93687.aspx">Snippy â€“ A C# code snippet editor</a> </b> I made it my weekend project to hack up an editor for code snippet files.  If you don't know what code snippets are, you should check out these two entries by [Shaykat](http://blogs.msdn.com/shaykatc/archive/2004/02/24/79481.aspx) and [Anson](http://blogs.msdn.com/ansonh/archive/2004/03/13/89185.aspx).  Shaykat provides a good overview of them in general and Anson touches on them a bit more and shows an example of what the XML for these looks like.
