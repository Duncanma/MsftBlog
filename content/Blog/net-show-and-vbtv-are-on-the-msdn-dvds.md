This might be common knowledge, but when [Darren](http://dotnetweblogs.com/dneimke/posts/7141.aspx) was in town he mentioned that downloading our multi-media presentations like [VBTV](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbtv/) and [the .NET Show](http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/) was too expensive from Australia due to the price of bandwidth... I had hoped to burn some to disc while he was here, but I forgot üôÅ Turns out they are on the DVD editions of the MSDN library subscription though;

<font face="'Courier New',Courier,monospace">For a brief summary of all seminars and presentations, with links to launch them, DVD subscribers should go to the \media\default.htm file on your July 2003 MSDN Library on DVD. This link will not work without the DVD.

No word yet if the [MSDN TV](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/) spots (those short 10-15 minute spots we've been doing lately) are also on the DVDs, but I hope they end up there.
