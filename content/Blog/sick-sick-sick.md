No idea what we've caught, but everyone in my family is sick.... and it has lasted for three days so far. Fever, shivering, sniffling, coughing, ugh... This was the first year that we all got flu shots and I'll tell you, we have never been sick so often ðŸ™‚

Of course, it is also Connor's first year in pre-school, so that could be a more likely cause... all those germ-buckets playing together can really spread a cold around.
