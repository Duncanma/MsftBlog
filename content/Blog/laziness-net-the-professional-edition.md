title: Laziness .NET â€“ the Professional Edition
type: posts
---
Back in June I published [a column](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun06272003.asp) showing you how to make a simple Pocket PC remote for Windows Media player. I didn't know it at the time, but some of my readers have sent in links to [a professional version of the same idea](http://www.zerama.net/). Built using the .NET Framework 1.1 and C#, [Zerama](http://www.zerama.net/) looks amazing... everything I wanted in mine, but built and supported by someone else (I love to code, but I'm happy to have someone else do it for me too!).



Check it out, pull down the demo from [here](http://www.zerama.net/download2.aspx) and then you can buy the full version for only $20.00.

Very cool stuff... even handles radio favorites and video content from your library!

Oh, and in case you are wondering... no kickbacks involved here folks... I'm just excited to see cool media related code created using .NET!
