title: Potentially confusing HDTV spec on game pages on Xbox.com
type: posts

With [the release of Scramble today](http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2006/09/13/Xbox-Live-Arcade-Scramble.aspx), I noticed something odd on the [game detail page on Xbox.com](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/s/scramblexboxlivearcade/default.htm). Along the left hand side is a listing of the specs of the game (# of players, does it work with Live, etc.) and it includes this interesting line: "HDTV 480i"



Hmm.... while I've never subscribed to the view that **only** 1080p is [HDTV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV), 480i is most certainly not. Yes, it is one of the resolutions that a HDTV monitor can usually display, but if it isn't 720p, 1080i or 1080p you can't really call it HDTV. Of course, this is probably just a typo... I believe a 360 game will always be capable of putting out at least 720p, even if it hasn't been optimized for that resolution. In fact, several other games list "HDTV: No Support" in their specs ([Time Pilot](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/t/timepilotxboxlivearcade/) for one), which is certainly not the case.
