title: Code Metrics in Visual Studio 2008 and the EvNet project
type: posts

I don't know if this is good or bad, but I thought it was neat that I could right-click the main project (excluding all our client script and HTML) that runs behind [on10.net](http://on10.net), pick code metrics and see cool #s like "23,442 lines of code" ðŸ™‚



Lately though, I've seen us reducing that number while adding features, so this might the highest result I'll ever see for this project ðŸ™‚
