title: jf.... send me your code...
type: posts

jf has been having issues with [my control](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/04/15/1321.aspx), and I have no idea why... if it will help, him or anyone else, there is the original version of the code and a test form available for download [here](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/samples/#divider)

Now, for jf specifically... feel free to email me your code and maybe I can see why it isn't working for you, thanks!
