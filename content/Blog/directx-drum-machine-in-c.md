A version of this code [appeared recently on MSDN Belux](http://www.vsdotnet.be/blogs/tommer/PermaLink,guid,1db61484-53ca-47cf-98b9-83a7417100a4.aspx), and it was so cool I asked [Ianier Munoz](http://www.chronotron.com/) if he'd mind turning it into a column for my Coding 4 Fun series.... lucky for me, he said yes and [here we are](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun02032004.asp)

You have got to check this one out...
