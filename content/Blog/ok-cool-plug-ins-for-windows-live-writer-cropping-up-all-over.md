title: Ok, cool plug-ins for Windows Live Writer cropping up all over
type: posts
---
If you are a dev, then [this code formatting plug-in](http://stevedunns.blogspot.com/2006/08/code-formatter-plugin-for-windows-live.html) is probably the coolest thing out there... I'm still ranking Tim's Flickr plug-in as #1 at the moment, at least my slightly customized version that is, but if you'd like a list of several available plug-ins then [this spaces entry](http://jeftek.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!F2042DC08607EF2!610.entry) is a good place to check out. Of course, if you have no idea what Windows Live Writer is... check out [this video from on10.net](http://www.on10.net/Blogs/TheShow/4891/) ðŸ™‚
