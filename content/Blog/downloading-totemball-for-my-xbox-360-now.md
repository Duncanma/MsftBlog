title: Downloading TotemBall for my Xbox 360 now!
type: posts

TotemBall, the gesture-based game that works with the Xbox Live Vision camera, just shipped to the Xbox Live Marketplace. It is a free download, but you need to have the camera to play. While you are waiting for it to download, check out [my video demo of TotemBall up on 10](http://on10.net/Blogs/duncan/totemball/).
