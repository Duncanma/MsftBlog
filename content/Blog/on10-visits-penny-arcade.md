Yesterday, Laura and I headed over to the offices of [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com) to interview them about... well, about a variety of things, it was a very interesting interview.

It may be hard to believe, but this was the best picture I could get. Someone's face is covered up in each and every shot I took, for some reason everyone was feeling very 'gesturey' that day. At least Jerry wasn't covered up ðŸ™‚
