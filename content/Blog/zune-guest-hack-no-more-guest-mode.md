title: Zune Guest Hack, no more 'guest mode'
type: posts

Marshillboy from Zuneboards.com has [posted a utility that lets you connect your Zune up to multiple PCs as if they were all the 'home' PC](http://www.zuneboards.com/content/view/52/2/). Personally I like the idea, although the main benefit for me would be if it didn't show any UI... right now, the 'hack' pops up its own dialog in place of the Zune one... so I have to click 'Next' either way. Why would I want that?
