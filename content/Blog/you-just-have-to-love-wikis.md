title: You just have to 'love' wikis...

(I'm kidding)

Wikis seem to be nothing but free space for spammers... yes, yes... I know.. [they have good aspects](http://www.pinvoke.net), but it seems whenever I get a link to a wiki, the odds I'm going to see what I expected are very low (and the odds of seeing farm animals in disturbing poses is high).

Today I decided to click on a link to see screenshots of GTK#, the UI engine in Mono, and they decided to post these shots onto a Wiki. No idea why they would do that, they certainly are capable of posting HTML to their own web sites, but whatever... I [clicked on the link](http://www.nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki/index.php/ScreenShots) and spent a few minutes trying to figure out what the hell I was looking at. Turns out someone filled the page with link spam, **deleting the content that was there**. Looking back through the page history I was able to find [the real content](http://www.nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki/index.php/ScreenShots?version=31), but I also got to see that this was [at least the 3rd or 4th time](http://www.nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki/index.php/ScreenShots?action=PageHistory&version=31) they had to restore their content after it had been destroyed by spammers.
