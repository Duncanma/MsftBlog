title: Running a new poll on databases...
type: posts
---
I've put up a new poll on my site:

> [What type of database do you use for the majority of your applications?](http://www.duncanmackenzie.net/)



If your answer is "something not on this list", why don't you post a comment on this blog entry to let me know what item was missing from my list?
