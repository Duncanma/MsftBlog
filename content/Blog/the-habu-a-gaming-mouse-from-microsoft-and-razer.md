Teaser sites are all the rage these days, but [this one](http://www.notfornoobs.com) ended pretty quickly to reveal [a new product from our hardware division](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/gaming/productdetails.aspx?pid=092). I don't really do much PC gaming, but I think this mouse might end up on my desk anyway... I love the blue lighting!!
