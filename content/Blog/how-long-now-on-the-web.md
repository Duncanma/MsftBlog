Olav Gausaker, a programmer who reads [my Coding 4 Fun columns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx) just emailed me with something cool... he wrote (before reading my column on the topic) [a web based version](http://www.herzios.com/halo2/) of [my "Halo2 Countdown" application from July](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/using/columns/code4fun/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncodefun/html/code4fun07012004.asp)... very nice... in fact, with the large images (refresh to see a variety of different pictures), I kinda like his better... except for being in Spanish, and on the web... ðŸ™‚
