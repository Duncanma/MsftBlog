title: Tonight's best posts...
type: posts
---
Forgive me in advance... I'm not posting about .NET, in fact I'm not going to say much at all except to post to two great posts

  * [Chris Sells: Same-Sex Marriages \*Should\* Be Allowed](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1154)
  * [Harry Pierson: In Support of Gay Marriage](http://devhawk.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=bb2c85ad-794b-46c9-b969-4891333c0702)
and then to a little web-shop that I heard about tonight... if you are into t-shirts with a message, forget about thinkgeek.com, check this out â€“ <http://cafeshops.com/getequal>

In case you are wondering, I'm certainly adding a +1 to the posts and the shop, but really... isn't that just common sense? To quote a bumper sticker from that online store... "Interracial marriage was illegal once too. Let's go forward, not backward."
