title: Last day at MSDN...
type: posts
---
[Earlier I annouced that I was leaving MSDN](http://blogs.duncanmackenzie.net/duncanma/archive/2005/12/17/3412.aspx), and my last day has arrived. I'm pretty excited about starting with the Channel 9 team next week though, my office here is empty and I'll be returning my MSDN machines today. Luckily for me, for the purposes of copying my old files over, I already have my new machine from the Channel 9 team, a Tecra M4 tablet PC. This is my first time using a Tablet, so I need to track down all the utilities and apps that will make the most of this cool convertible machine.
