title: Interesting quote from a GotDotNet discussion on .NET Shareware...
type: posts
---
Anytime people talk about developing shareware with .NET, the discussion centers around the download/install of the Framework, because that is the issue that seems like the biggest hurdle to non-corporate developers... I could go on and on about the various methods of getting the Framework installed in 1.1 and in 2.0, but I like what Nick posted to the forum;



> _...your audience will judge your app based only on the advantages it offers, its price, ease of use and generally things that are used as criteria for every other app, .Net based or not. If the app provides real value for the $buck$, the vast majority of users won't really mind downloading the framework..._
