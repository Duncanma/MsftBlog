I've been stoked for some time by the [completely black case replacement](http://www.decalgirl.com/browse.cfm/4,4150.htm) for the 360, but now I've found out that I can potentially [switch my controllers (even the wireless ones) to custom colors as well](http://www.lik-sang.com/news.php?artc=3819&)... very very sweet.
