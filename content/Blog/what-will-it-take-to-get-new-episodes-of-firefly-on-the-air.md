title: What will it take to get new episodes of Firefly on the air?
type: posts

I was just at Redmond Town Center, an open-air mall, and I saw a bunch of folks wearing t-shirts that read "Joss Whedon is my master now" ([see here](http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/pvp/77da/) and [here](http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20050510)) ... and I started thinking; how well does [this movie](http://www.serenitymovie.com/) have to do to get the show back? Should everyone who loves it go see the movie twice? three times? Buy the [DVD box set](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AQS0F/duncanmackenz-20?creative=327641&#038;camp=14573&#038;link_code=as1)?
