I was telling the folks at work about this one yesterday, my wife and I had been watching the Daily Show when it came on and although we never watch commercials, we silently watched this entire one. We were very impressed... and then the Vista logo came up and we were stunned. Good work on this one, Vista Marketing Team ðŸ™‚
