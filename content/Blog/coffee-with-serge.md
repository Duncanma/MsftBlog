We discussed a variety of topics, including the idea of adding a 'user submitted links' section to MSDN that functions somewhat like what [http://www.asp.net](http://www.asp.net) has on the home page (a list of resources that have been submitted by anyone who cares to do so, and then approved by a small body of insiders). What do you think of this idea?
