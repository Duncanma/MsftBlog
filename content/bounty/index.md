title: Microsoft Bug Bounty Program
---
Microsoft strongly believes close partnerships with researchers make customers more secure. Security researchers play an integral role in the ecosystem by discovering vulnerabilities missed in the software development process. Each year we partner together to better protect billions of customers worldwide.

If you are a security researcher that has found a vulnerability in a Microsoft product, service, or device we want to hear from you. If your vulnerability report affects a product or service that is within scope of one of our bounty programs below, you may receive a bounty award according to the program descriptions. Even if it is not covered under an existing bounty program, we will publicly acknowledge your contributions when we fix the vulnerability. All vulnerability submissions are counted in our [Researcher Recognition Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-recognition-program) and leaderboard, even if they do not qualify for bounty award.

## Let the hunt begin!

Our bug bounty programs are divided by technology area though they generally have the same high level requirements:

### We want to award you for your research

Submissions that contain steps to reproduce your proof of concept code along with a detailed analysis are eligible for higher awards because they help us quickly assess the risk posed by a vulnerability.

### We are looking for new and novel vulnerabilities

Your contributions help us address vulnerabilities we may have missed in the development process. If you are the first external researcher to identify a vulnerability we already know about and are working to fix you may still be eligible for a bounty reward.

### Avoid harm to customer data, privacy, and service availability

Some security research may occur on product services that our customers use and depend on. Do your best to avoid research that violates customer privacy, destroys data, or interrupts service. If you discover customer data while researching, or are unclear if it is safe to proceed, please stop immediately and contact us so we can take immediate action to resolve the issue and protect our customers.

### Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure

Our customer's security is important to us. If you find a vulnerability in our products, services, or devices, report it to us privately and give us the opportunity to correct the vulnerability and protect our customers before disclosing it publicly. We will work on each report diligently and to address it in a reasonable time. In recognition of your partnership we offer bounty awards and will acknowledge your contributions to customer security when the vulnerability is fixed.
