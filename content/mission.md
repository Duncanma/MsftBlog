The world is more connected today than it has ever been. Technology is wound deep into our lives and has become part of our routine. With great advances we have also seen a greater dynamic playing out between threat actors and the defenders. The **Microsoft Security Response Center** is part of the defender community and on the front line of security response evolution. For over twenty years we have been working to improve security for customers. We have learned from both our successes and our failures. Time has only reasserted our commitment to better protect customers and the broader ecosystem.

**Our mission is to protect customers and Microsoft from current and emerging threats related to security and privacy.** We see this playing out in our everyday business by focusing on preventing harm, fast defense, and building trust in the community.

As the threat landscape evolves, so will we. Defense is not a static game; it requires continual engagement and innovation. It also requires working with the security community. Together, we will find ways to better protect customers and the broader ecosystem.
